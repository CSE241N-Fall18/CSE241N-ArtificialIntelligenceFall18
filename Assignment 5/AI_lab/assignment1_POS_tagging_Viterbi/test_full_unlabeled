read
the

###
It

not

This

gleaned
from
your

on
the

.
###
Past

tolerance
of
the

suggest
that
The

well
as

should
put

--
Anton

Gourlay
were

Mr.

,
46
years

of

most
recently
,
he

is

he
was

###
In
the
wake
of
a
slide
in
sterling
,
a
tailspin
in
the
stock
market
,
and
a
string
of
problematic
economic
indicators
,
British
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
Nigel
Lawson
promised
gradual
improvement
in
the
U.K.
economy
.
###
In
a
speech
prepared
for
delivery
to
London
's
financial
community
,
Mr.
Lawson
summed
up
current
economic
policy
as
a
battle
to
wring
inflation
out
of
the
British
economy
,
using
high
interest
rates
as
``
the
essential
instrument
''
to
carry
out
the
campaign
.
###
Two
weeks
after
boosting
base
rates
to
15
%
,
he
pledged
that
``
rates
will
have
to
remain
high
for
some
time
to
come
.
''
###
Mr.
Lawson
also
made
it
clear
that
he
would
be
watching
exchange
rates
carefully
.
###
A
sinking
pound
makes
imports
more
expensive
and
increases
businesses
'
expectations
of
future
inflation
,
he
argued
.
###
In
an
apparent
warning
to
currency
traders
who
have
lately
been
selling
the
British
currency
,
he
stated
that
the
exchange
rates
will
have
a
``
major
role
in
the
assessment
of
monetary
conditions
.
''
###
In
reaffirming
the
current
monetary
policy
of
using
high
interest
rates
to
fight
inflation
and
shore
up
the
pound
,
Mr.
Lawson
dismissed
other
approaches
to
managing
the
economy
.
###
He
said
he
monitors
the
money-supply
figures
,
but
does
n't
give
them
paramount
importance
,
as
some
private
and
government
economists
have
suggested
.
###
Mr.
Lawson
also
dismissed
the
possibility
of
imposing
direct
credit
controls
on
Britain
's
financial
system
.
###
Mr.
Lawson
's
speech
,
delivered
at
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
's
annual
dinner
at
Mansion
House
,
came
on
the
heels
of
a
grueling
period
for
the
U.K.
economy
.
###
Two
weeks
ago
,
in
a
campaign
to
blunt
inflation
at
home
and
arrest
a
world-wide
plunge
in
the
pound
,
he
raised
base
rates
a
full
percentage
point
to
15
%
.
###
Despite
the
increase
,
the
British
currency
slid
below
a
perceived
threshold
of
three
marks
early
last
week
.
###
It
was
quoted
at
2.9428
marks
in
late
New
York
trading
Wednesday
.
###
Leading
up
to
the
speech
was
a
drumroll
of
economic
statistics
suggesting
that
the
British
war
on
inflation
will
be
more
bruising
than
previously
assumed
.
###
Unemployment
in
September
dropped
to
1,695,000
,
the
lowest
level
since
1980
.
###
While
lower
joblessness
is
generally
good
news
,
the
hefty
drop
last
month
indicates
that
the
economy
is
n't
slowing
down
as
much
as
hoped
--
despite
a
doubling
of
interest
rates
over
the
last
16
months
.
###
Meanwhile
,
average
earnings
in
Britain
were
up
8.75
%
in
August
over
the
previous
year
.
###
Another
inflationary
sign
came
in
a
surge
in
building-society
lending
to
a
record
#
10.2
billion
-LRB-
$
16.22
billion
-RRB-
last
month
,
a
much
higher
level
than
economists
had
predicted
.
###
In
a
separate
speech
prepared
for
delivery
at
the
dinner
,
Robin
Leigh-Pemberton
,
Bank
of
England
governor
,
conceded
that
``
demand
pressures
were
even
more
buoyant
than
had
been
appreciated
''
when
the
British
economy
was
heating
up
last
year
.
###
He
added
that
``
there
's
no
quick-fix
solution
''
to
the
economic
woes
,
and
said
``
tight
monetary
policy
is
the
right
approach
.
''
###
Discussing
the
recent
slide
in
stock
prices
,
the
central
bank
governor
stated
that
``
the
markets
now
appear
to
have
steadied
''
after
the
``
nasty
jolt
''
of
the
190.58-point
plunge
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
a
week
ago
.
###
Although
the
New
York
market
plunge
prompted
a
70.5-point
drop
in
the
London
Financial
Times-Stock
Exchange
100
Share
Index
,
Mr.
Leigh-Pemberton
declared
``
that
the
experience
owed
nothing
to
the
particular
problems
of
the
British
economy
.
''
###
Specifically
,
he
pointed
out
that
compared
with
the
U.S.
market
,
the
U.K.
has
far
fewer
highly
leveraged
junk-bond
financings
.
###
Discussing
future
monetary
arrangements
,
Mr.
Lawson
repeated
the
Thatcher
government
's
commitment
to
join
the
exchange
rate
mechanism
of
the
European
Monetary
System
,
but
he
did
n't
indicate
when
.
###
C.
Olivetti
&
Co.
,
claiming
it
has
won
the
race
in
Europe
to
introduce
computers
based
on
a
powerful
new
microprocessor
chip
,
unveiled
its
CP486
computer
yesterday
.
###
The
product
is
the
first
from
a
European
company
based
on
Intel
Corp.
's
new
32-bit
486tm
microprocessor
,
which
works
several
times
faster
than
previously
available
chips
.
###
Hewlett-Packard
Co.
became
the
first
company
world-wide
to
announce
a
product
based
on
the
chip
earlier
this
month
,
but
it
wo
n't
start
shipping
the
computers
until
early
next
year
.
###
An
Olivetti
spokesman
said
the
company
's
factories
are
already
beginning
to
produce
the
machine
,
and
that
it
should
be
available
in
Europe
by
December
.
###
``
What
this
means
is
that
Europeans
will
have
these
machines
in
their
offices
before
Americans
do
,
''
the
spokesman
said
.
###
The
new
chip
``
is
a
very
big
step
in
computing
,
and
it
is
important
that
Olivetti
be
one
of
the
first
out
on
the
market
with
this
product
,
''
said
Patricia
Meagher
Davis
,
an
analyst
at
James
Capel
&
Co.
in
London
.
###
Executives
at
Olivetti
,
whose
earnings
have
been
steadily
sliding
over
the
past
couple
of
years
,
have
acknowledged
that
in
the
past
they
have
lagged
at
getting
new
technology
to
market
.
###
Ms.
Davis
said
the
new
machines
could
steal
some
sales
away
from
Olivetti
's
own
minicomputers
,
but
would
bring
new
sales
among
professionals
such
as
engineers
,
stockbrokers
and
medical
doctors
.
###
Although
Olivetti
's
profits
tumbled
40
%
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
,
she
believes
Olivetti
's
restructuring
last
fall
and
its
introduction
of
new
products
will
begin
to
bear
fruit
with
an
earnings
rebound
next
year
,
especially
if
it
can
fulfill
its
promise
to
deliver
the
new
machines
by
December
.
###
``
We
think
the
worst
is
over
''
in
the
European
information-technology
market
,
she
said
.
###
Depending
on
the
type
of
software
and
peripherals
used
,
the
machines
can
serve
either
as
the
main
computer
in
a
network
of
many
terminals
-LRB-
a
role
usually
filled
by
a
minicomputer
-RRB-
,
as
a
technical
workstation
or
as
a
very
fast
personal
computer
.
###
``
It
's
the
missing
link
''
in
Olivetti
's
product
line
between
small
personal
computers
and
higher-priced
minicomputers
,
the
Olivetti
spokesman
said
.
###
He
added
that
Olivetti
will
continue
making
its
LSX
minicomputer
line
.
###
The
machines
will
cost
around
$
16,250
on
average
in
Europe
.
###
The
Intel
486
chip
can
process
15
million
instructions
per
second
,
or
MIPS
,
while
Intel
's
previous
386
chip
could
handle
only
3
to
6
MIPS
.
###
Olivetti
also
plans
to
sell
the
CP486
computer
in
the
U.S.
starting
next
year
through
Olivetti
USA
and
through
its
Ramo
unit
,
which
specializes
in
automating
bank-branch
networks
.
###
Viatech
Inc.
said
it
received
approval
from
the
French
government
for
its
proposed
$
44.7
million
acquisition
of
Ferembal
S.A
.
###
The
approval
satisfies
the
remaining
conditions
of
the
purchase
,
which
is
expected
to
close
within
two
weeks
.
###
erembal
,
the
second-largest
maker
of
food
cans
in
France
,
had
1988
sales
of
$
150
million
.
###
Ferembal
has
930
workers
at
four
canning
manufacturing
plants
and
one
plastic
container
facility
.
###
Viatech
makes
flexible
packaging
films
and
machinery
,
and
materials
for
the
food
and
pharmaceutical
industries
.
###
Social
Security
benefits
will
rise
4.7
%
next
year
to
keep
pace
with
inflation
,
boosting
the
average
monthly
benefit
to
$
566
from
$
541
,
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
announced
.
###
The
higher
payments
will
start
with
Social
Security
checks
received
on
Jan.
3
,
1990
.
###
Supplemental
Security
Income
payments
to
the
disabled
also
will
rise
4.7
%
,
starting
with
checks
received
on
Dec.
29
,
1988
,
increasing
the
maximum
SSI
payment
to
$
386
from
$
368
a
month
.
###
The
inflation
adjustment
also
means
that
the
maximum
annual
level
of
earnings
subject
to
the
wage
tax
that
generates
revenue
for
the
Social
Security
trust
fund
will
rise
to
$
50,400
in
1990
from
$
48,000
this
year
.
###
As
mandated
by
law
,
the
tax
rate
will
rise
to
7.65
%
in
1990
from
7.51
%
and
wo
n't
rise
any
further
in
the
future
.
###
This
means
that
the
maximum
yearly
Social
Security
tax
paid
by
workers
and
employers
each
will
rise
$
250.80
next
year
to
$
3,855.60
.
###
Beneficiaries
aged
65
through
69
will
be
able
to
earn
$
9,360
without
losing
any
Social
Security
benefits
in
1990
,
up
from
$
8,880
this
year
.
###
The
exempt
amount
for
beneficiaries
under
65
will
rise
to
$
6,840
from
$
6,480
.
###
The
adjustments
reflect
the
increase
in
the
consumer
price
index
for
urban
wage
earners
and
clerical
workers
from
the
third
quarter
of
last
year
to
the
third
quarter
of
this
year
.
###
Health-care
companies
should
get
healthier
in
the
third
quarter
.
###
Medical-supply
houses
are
expected
to
report
earnings
increases
of
about
15
%
on
average
for
the
third
quarter
,
despite
sales
increases
of
less
than
10
%
,
analysts
say
.
###
To
offset
sluggish
sales
growth
,
companies
have
been
cutting
staff
,
mostly
through
attrition
,
and
slowing
the
growth
in
research
and
development
spending
.
###
Sales
growth
in
the
quarter
was
slowed
by
mounting
pressure
from
groups
of
buyers
,
such
as
hospitals
,
to
hold
down
prices
.
###
Suppliers
were
also
hurt
by
the
stronger
U.S.
dollar
,
which
makes
sales
abroad
more
difficult
.
###
In
some
cases
,
competition
has
squeezed
margins
.
###
Becton
,
Dickinson
&
Co.
,
for
example
,
faces
stiff
competition
from
a
Japanese
supplier
in
the
important
syringe
market
.
###
The
Franklin
Lakes
,
N.J.
,
company
is
expected
to
report
sales
growth
of
only
5
%
to
6
%
,
but
should
still
maintain
earnings
growth
of
10
%
,
says
Jerry
E.
Fuller
,
an
analyst
with
Duff
&
Phelps
Inc
.
###
Among
the
first
of
the
group
to
post
results
,
Abbott

said
third-quarter
net
income
jumped
14

in
Abbott

,
Ill.
,
rose
8.3
%
to
$
1.31

###
Baxter

yesterday
reported

company
rose
5.8
%
to
$
1.81
billion
from
$
1.71
billion
.
###
But
not
every
company
expects
to
report
increased
earnings
.
###
C.R.
Bard
Inc.
yesterday
said
third-quarter
net
plunged
51
%
to
$
9.9
million
,
or
18
cents
a
share
,
from
$
20
million
,
or
35
cents
a

,
a
year
earlier
.
###
Sales
fell
1.2
%
to
$
190.1
million
from
$
192.5
million
.
###
The
Murray
Hill
,
N.J.
,
company
said
full-year
earnings
may
be
off
33
cents
a
share
because
the
company
removed
a
catheter
from
the
market
.
###
In
1988
,
the
company
earned
$
1.38
a
share
.
###
The
Food
and
Drug
Administration
had
raised
questions
about
the
device
's
design
.
###
Some
analysts
add
that
third-party
pressures
to
reduce
health
costs
will
continue
to
bedevil
companies
'
bottom
lines
.
###
Takeover
speculation
,
which
has
been
buoying
stocks
of
supply
houses
,
may
also
ease
,
says
Peter
Sidoti
,
an
analyst
with
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc
.
###
``
As
that
wanes
,
you
're
going
to
see
the
stocks
probably
wane
as
well
,
''
he
says
.
###
Hospitals
companies
,
meanwhile
,
are
reporting
improved
earnings
.
###
Bolstered
by
strong
performances
by
its
psychiatric
hospitals
,
National
Medical
Enterprises
Inc.
,
Los
Angeles
,
reported
net
income
of
$
50
million
,
or
65
cents

also
reported
favorable

###
Analysts
say
the
handful
of
hospital
companies
that
are
still
publicly
traded
are
benefiting
from
several
trends
.
###
Most
important
,
hospital
admission
rates
are
stabilizing
after
several
years
of
decline
.
###
Moreover
,
companies
have
sold
off
many
of
their
smaller
,
less-profitable
hospitals
and
have
completed

Initial
claims
for
regular

unemployment
benefits
rose
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
396,000
during
the
week
ended
Oct.
7
from
334,000
the
previous
week
,
the
Labor
Department
said
.
###
The
number
of
people
receiving
regular
state
benefits
in
the
week
ended
Sept.
30
decreased
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
2,202,000
,
or
2.2
%
of
those
covered
by
unemployment
insurance
,
from
2,205,000
the
previous
week
,
when
the
insured
unemployment
rate
also
was
2.2

###
Counting
all
state
and
federal
benefit
programs
,
the
number
of
people
receiving
unemployment
benefits
in
the
week
ended
Sept.
30
fell
to
1,809,300
from
1,838,200
a
week
earlier
.
###
These
figures
are
n't
seasonally
adjusted
.
###
A
Labor
Department
spokesman
said
the
unusually
high
number
of
initial
claims
for
state
unemployment
benefits
reflects
the
impact
of
Hurricane
Hugo
on
southern
states
,
particularly
North
Carolina
and
South
Carolina
.
###
The
figure
also
may
reflect
initial
claims
filed
by
striking
Nynex
Corp.
workers
who
have
become
eligible
for
unemployment
benefits
,
the
official
said
.
###
Digital
Equipment
Corp.
reported
a
32
%
decline
in
net
income
on
a
modest
revenue
gain
in
its
fiscal
first
quarter
,
causing
some
analysts
to
predict
weaker
results
ahead
than
they
had
expected
.
###
Although
the
second-largest
computer
maker
had
prepared
Wall
Street
for
a
poor
quarter
,
analysts
said
they
were
troubled
by
signs
of
flat
U.S.
orders
and
a
slowdown
in
the
rate
of
gain
in
foreign
orders
.
###
The
Maynard
,
Mass.
,
company
is
in
a
transition
in
which
it
is
trying
to
reduce
its
reliance
on
mid-range
machines
and
establish
a
presence
in
workstations
and
mainframes
.
###
Net
for
the
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
fell
to
$
150.8
million
,
or
$
1.20
a
share
,
from
$
223
million
,
or
$
1.71
a
share
,
a
year
ago
.
###
Revenue
rose
6.4
%
to
$
3.13
billion
from
$
2.94
billion
.
###
Digital
said
a
shift
in
its
product
mix
toward
low-end
products
and
strong
growth
in
workstation
sales
yielded
lower
gross
margins
.
###
A
spokesman
also
said
margins
for
the
company
's
service
business
narrowed
somewhat
because
of
heavy
investments
made
in
that
sector
.
###
The
lack
of
a
strong
product
at
the
high
end
of
Digital
's
line
was
a
significant
drag
on
sales
.
###
Digital
hopes
to
address
that
with
the
debut
of
its
first
mainframe-class
computers
next
Tuesday
.
###
The
new
line
is
aimed
directly
at
International
Business
Machines
Corp
.
###
``
Until
the
new
mainframe
products
kick
in
,
there
wo
n't
be
a
lot
of
revenue
contribution
at
the
high
end
,
and
that
's
hurt
us
,
''
said
Mark
Steinkrauss
,
Digital
's
director
of
investor
relations
.
###
He
said
unfavorable
currency
translations
were
also
a
factor
in
the

DEC
shares
rose
$
1.375
to
$
89.75
apiece
in
consolidated
New
York
Stock
Exchange
trading
yesterday
.
###
But
analysts
said
that
against
the
backdrop
of
a
nearly
40-point
rise
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
,
that
should
n't
necessarily
be
taken
as
a
sign
of
great
strength
.
###
Some
cut
their
earnings
estimates
for
the
stock
this
year
and
predicted
more
efforts
to
control
costs
ahead
.
###
``
I
think
the
next
few
quarters
will
be
difficult
,
''
said
Steven
Milunovich
of
First
Boston
.
###
``
Margins
will
remain
under
pressure
,
and
when
the
new
mainframe
does
ship
,
I
'm
not
sure
it
will
be
a
big
winner
.
###
''
Mr.
Milunovich
said
he
was
revising
his
estimate
for
DEC
's
current
year
from
$
8.20
a
share
to
``
well
below
$
8
,
''
although
he
has
n't
settled
on
a
final
number
.
###
One
troubling
aspect
of
DEC
's
results
,
analysts
said
,
was
its
performance
in
Europe
.
###
DEC
said
its
overseas
business
,
which
now
accounts
for
more
than
half
of
sales
,
improved
in
the
quarter
.
###
It
even
took
the
unusually
frank
step
of
telling
analysts
in
a
morning
conference
call
that
orders
in
Europe
were
up
in
``
double
digits
''
in
foreign-currency
terms
.
###
That
gain
probably
translated
into
about
5
%
to
7
%
in
dollar
terms
,
well
below
recent
quarters
'
gains
of
above
20
%
,
reckons
Jay
Stevens
of
Dean
Witter
Reynolds
.
###
``
That
was
a
disappointment
''
and
a
sign
of
overall
computer-market
softness
in
Europe
,
Mr.
Stevens
said
.
###
Marc
Schulman
,
with
UBS
Securities
in
New
York
,
dropped
his
estimate
of
DEC
's
full-year
net
to
$
6.80
a
share
from
$
8
.
###
Although
overall
revenues
were
stronger
,
Mr.
Schulman
said
,
DEC
``
drew
down
its
European
backlog
''
and
had
flat
world-wide
orders
overall
.
###
``
The
bottom
line
is
that
it
's
more
hand
to
mouth
than
it
has
been
before
,
''
he
said
.
###
Mr.
Schulman
said
he
believes
that
the
roll-out
of
DEC
's
new
mainframe
will
``
occur
somewhat
more
leisurely
''
than
many
of
his
investment
colleagues
expect
.
###
He
said
current
expectations
are
for
an
entry
level
machine
to
be
shipped
in
December
,
with
all
of
the
more
sophisticated
versions
out
by
June
.
###
For
reasons
he
would
n't
elaborate
on
,
he
said
he
's
sure
that
schedule
wo
n't
be
met
,
meaning
less
profit
impact
from
the
product
for
DEC
in
the
next
few
quarters
.

Colgate

Co.
reported
third-quarter
net
income
rose
27
%

bolstered
by
strong
sales
in
its
Latin
American
business
and
surprisingly
healthy
profits
from
U.S.
operations

Colgate
said
net
income
for
the
quarter
rose
to
$
76.7
million

on

###
Reuben
Mark

earnings

was
fueled
by
strong
sales
in
Latin

the

Results
were
also
bolstered
by
``
a
very
meaningful
increase
in
operating

at
Colgate

,
jumped
more

,
the

###
Mr.

attributed
the
improvement
to
cost

achieved
by
consolidating

###
The
scope
of
the
improvement
in
the
U.S.
business
caught
some
analysts
by
surprise
.
###
The
company
's
domestic
business
,
especially
its
household
products
division
,
has
performed
poorly
for
years
.
###
Analysts
say
the
earnings
improvement
came
from
cutting
costs
rather
than
increasing
sales
.
###
For
the
nine
months
,
net
increased
14
%
to
$
217.5
million
,
or
$
3.09
a

###
Sales
rose
7

The
company
earned
$

or
$
2.79
a

in
the
year-earlier
period
.
###
Colgate
's
1988
net

included
$

or
59

a

,
from

###
Colgate
sold
its
hospital

last

###
Separately
,
Colgate
Wednesday
finalized
an
agreement
with
MacroChem
Corp.
,
a
tiny
dental
products
and
pharmaceutical
concern
based
in
Billerica
,
Mass.
,
to
market
in
the
U.S.
four
of
MacroChem
's
FDA-approved
dental

.
###
The
products
--
sealants
and
bonding
materials
used
by
dentists
--
all
contain
fluoride
that
is
released
over
time
.
###
The
move
is
part
of
a
drive
to
increase
Colgate
's
business
with
dentists
,
a
company
spokeswoman
said
.
###
Terms
of
the
agreement
were
n't
given

###
USACafes
Limited
Partnership
said
it
completed
the
sale
of
its
Bonanza
restaurant
franchise
system
to
a
subsidiary
of
Metromedia
Co.
for
$
71
million
in
cash
.
###
USACafes
,
which
is
nearly
half-owned
by
Sam
and
Charles
Wyly
of
Dallas
,
said
it
will
distribute
proceeds
from
the
sale
to
unit
holders
as
a
liquidating
dividend
as
soon
as
possible
.
###
The
Bonanza
franchise
system
,
which
generates
about
$
600
million
in
sales
annually
,
represented
substantially
all
of
the
partnership
's
assets
.
###
The
sale
of
the
system
has
been
challenged
in
a
class-action
suit
on
behalf
of
unit
holders
filed
last
week
in
a
Delaware
court
,
USACafes
said
.
###
The
company
said
it
believes
the
suit
is
without
merit
.
###
American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
Co.
unveiled
a
sweetened
pension
and
early-retirement
program
for
management
that
it
hopes
will
enable
it
to
save
$
450
million
in
the
next
year
.
###
AT&T
also
said
net
income
rose
19
%
in
the
third
quarter
.
###
AT&T
said
its
amended
pension
program
will
nearly
double
to
34,000
the
number
of
managers
eligible
to
retire
with
immediate
pension
payments
.
###
AT&T
said
that
based
on
studies
of
other
companies
that
have
offered
retirement
plans
,
it
expects
about
one-third
of
its
eligible
managers
to
retire
under
the
new
program
.
###
AT&T
said
third-quarter
net
income
grew
,
despite
stiff
competition
in
all
of
the
company
's
markets
.
###
Net
income
rose
to
$
699
million
,
or
65
cents
a
share
,
from
the
year-earlier
$
587
million
or
55
cents
a
share
.
###
Revenue
edged
up
to
$
8.9
billion
from
$
8.81
billion
.
###
The
latest
period
's
net
was
reduced
$
102
million
,
or
nine
cents
a
share
,
for
a
change
in
depreciation
method
and
concurrent
changes
in
estimates
of
depreciable
lives
and
net
salvage
for
certain
telecommunications
equipment
.
###
The
results
roughly
matched
estimates
of
securities
analysts
,
who
were
encouraged
by
AT&T
increasing
its
operating
margin
to
13
%
from
11
%
a
year
ago
,
because
of
continued
cost-cutting
efforts
.
###
Sales
of
long-distance
services
,
an
extremely
competitive
market
,
rose
6.4
%
.
###
But
the
growth
was
partly
offset
by
lower
equipment
sales
and
rentals
and
price
cuts
on
some
products
.
###
Under
the
amended
pension
program
,
AT&T
managers
who
have
at
least
five
years
of
service
will
have
five
years
added
to
their
age
and
length
of
service
for
pension
purposes
.
###
Managers
who
retire
Dec.
30
will
have
an
additional
15
%
added
to
their
monthly
pension
for
as
long
as
five
years
or
age
65
,
whichever
comes
earlier
.
###
An
AT&T
spokeswoman
said
the
company
would
likely
replace
about
one-third
of
its
managers
who
choose
to
retire
with
new
employees
.
###
Analysts
hailed
the
sweetened
pension
package
,
which
they
said
had
been
the
subject
of
rumors
for
several
months
.
###
``
This
tells
you
AT&T
is
serious
about
continuing
to
manage
their
cost
structure
and
is
committed
to
20%-a-year
earnings
growth
,
''
said
Jack
Grubman
,
an
analyst
with
PaineWebber
Inc
.
###
But
other
analysts
expressed
disappointment
that
the
cost-cutting
move
wo
n't
result
in
even
greater
earnings
growth
.
###
``
This
is
a
good
move
,
but
it
only
gets
you
to
where
people
's
expectations
already
are
,
''
in
terms
of
earnings
growth
,
said
Joel
D.
Gross
,
an
analyst
with
Donaldson
,
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
.
###
Mr.
Gross
said
he
had
hoped
that
a
cost
savings
of
$
450
million
would
result
in
even
greater
growth
than
the
20
%
annual
earnings
increase
AT&T
has
told
analysts
it
expects
in
the
future
.
###
AT&T
said
the
special
retirement
option
will
increase
fourth-quarter
expenses
.
###
But
the
company
said
the
amount
ca
n't
be
determined
until
it
knows
how
many
managers
opt
to
retire
.
###
AT&T
said
the
expense
increase
will
be
largely
offset
by
a
gain
from
its
previously
announced
plan
to
swap
its
holdings
in
Ing
.
C.
Olivetti
&
Co.
for
shares
in
Cie
.
Industriali
Riunite
,
an
Italian
holding
company
.
###
For
the
nine
months
,
AT&T
said
net
income
was
$
1.99
billion
,
or
$
1.85
a
share
,
up
19
%
from
$
1.67
billion
,
or
$
1.56
a

###
Revenue
gained
3.1
%

###
When
it
comes
to
buying
and
selling
shares
,
Westridge
Capital
Management
Inc.
takes
a
back
seat
to
no
one
.
###
Every
dollar
's
worth
of
stock
in
the
Los
Angeles
money
manager
's
portfolio
is
traded
seven
or
eight
times
a
year
,
the
firm
estimates
.
###
That
makes
it
the
most
active
trader
among
all
the
nation
's
investment
advisers
,
according
to
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filings
.
###
But
wait
a
second
.
###
Westridge
Capital
is
an
index
fund
--
the
type
of
stolid
long-term
investor
whose
goal
is
to
be
nothing
more
than
average
.
###
Westridge
Capital
's
frenetic
trading
reflects
the
changes
sweeping
through
the
previously
sleepy
world
of
indexing
.
###
Indexing
for
the
most
part
has
involved
simply
buying
and
then
holding
stocks
in
the
correct
mix
to
mirror
a
stock
market
barometer
,
such
as
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
,
and
match
its
performance
.
###
Institutional
investors
have
poured
$
210
billion
into
stock
and
bond
indexing
as
a
cheap
and
easy
form
of
investment
management
that
promises
to
post
average
market
returns
.
###
These
big
investors
have
flocked
to
indexing
because
relatively
few
``
active
''
stock
pickers
have
been
able
to
consistently
match
the
returns
of
the
S&P
500
or
other
bellwethers
,
much
less
beat
it
.
###
And
the
fees
investors
pay
for
indexing
run
a
few
pennies
for
each
$
100
of
assets
--
a
fraction
of
the
cost
of
active
managers
.
###
That
's
because
computers
do
most
of
the
work
,
and
low
trading
activity
keeps
a
lid
on
commission
costs
.
###
But
today
,
indexing
is
moving
from
a
passive
investment
strategy
to
an
increasingly
active
one
.
###
Because
index-fund
managers
are
no
longer
satisfied
with
merely
being
average
,
they
have
developed
``
enhanced
''
indexing
strategies
that
are
intended
to
outperform
the
market
as
much
as
three
percentage
points
.
###
``
Indexing
has
been
the
most
single
successful
investment
concept
in
the
last
decade
,
but
the
index
money
has
been
just
sort
of
sitting
there
,
''
says
Seth
M.
Lynn
,
president
of
Axe
Core
Investors
Inc.
,
an
indexer
based
in
Tarrytown
,
N.Y
.
###
``
Now
the
interest
is
in
what
else
can
I
do
with
that
money
.
''
###
Among
the
souped-up
indexing
strategies
:
Indexed
portfolios
can
be
built
around
thousands
of
stocks
,
or
just
a
few
dozen
,
rather
than
being
restricted
to
the
S&P
500
companies
.
###
They
can
ignore
the
S&P
500
stocks
altogether
and
focus
on
particular
types
of
stocks
,
such
as
smaller
companies
,
those
paying
high
dividends
or
companies
in
a
particular
industry
,
state
or
country
.
###
With
today
's
computer-driven
program
trading
techniques
,
index
funds
can
trade
back
and
forth
between
stock-index
futures
and
the
actual
stocks
making
up
indexes
such
as
the
S&P
500
.
###
Futures
and
options
also
make
it
possible
to
build
``
synthetic
''
index
funds
that
do
n't
actually
own
a
single
share
of
stock
,
but
can
produce
returns
that
match
or
exceed
the
broad
stock
market
.
###
One
reason
for
these
hybrids
is
that
indexing
's
rapid
growth
is
slowing
,
particularly
for
those
``
plain
vanilla
''
funds
that
mirror
the
500
.
###
``
There
is
n't
a
boatload
-LCB-
of
big
investors
-RCB-
out
there
still
waiting
to
get
into
indexing
,
''
says
P.
James
Kartalia
,
vice
president
of
ANB
Investment
Management
Co.
,
Chicago
,
which
offers
both
indexing
and
active
management
services
.
###
After
tripling
in
size
in
the
past
five
years
,
index
funds
now
hold
about
20
%
of
the
stock
owned
by
pension
funds
.
###
A
further
problem
is
razor-thin
profits
.
###
Plain-vanilla
funds
have
become
so
commonplace
that
fees
they
can
charge
have
plunged
to
almost
nothing
,
and
in
some
cases
are
just
that
.
###
To
land
customers
for
their
well-paying
stock
custodial
business
,
big
banks
sometimes
will
throw
in
basic
indexing
services
for
free
.
###
``
It
's
like
getting
a
free
toaster
when
you
open
an
account
,
''
says
Axe
Core
's
Mr.
Lynn
.
###
As
a
result
,
indexers
have
been
looking
for
ways
to
give
investors
something
more
than
the
average
for
their
money
.
###
And
many
have
been
successful
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
index
fund
operated
by
hyper-trader
Westridge
Capital
.
###
Westridge
Capital
has
used
enhanced
indexing
techniques
to
beat
the
S&P
500
's
returns
by
2.5
to
3
percentage
points
over
the
past
four
years
,
with
the
same
risk
level
as
holding
the
S&P
500
stocks
,
according
to
James
Carder
,
the
firm
's
president
.
###
Strategies
vary
for
Westridge
Capital
,
which
has
$
300
million
under
management
.
###
The
firm
sometimes
buys
S&P
500
futures
when
they
are
selling
at
a
discount
to
the
actual
stocks
,
and
will
switch
back
and
forth
between
stocks
and
stock-index
futures
to
take
advantages
of
any
momentary
price
discrepencies
.
###
Mr.
Carder
also
goes
through
periods
when
he
buys
stocks
in
conjunction
with
options
to
boost
returns
and
protect
against
declines
.
###
And
in
some
months
,
he
buys
stock-index
futures
and
not
stocks
at
all
.
###
``
By
their
nature
,
our
trades
are
very
short-term
and
are
going
to
create
high
turnover
,
''
Mr.
Carder
adds
.
###
``
The
more
turnover
,
the
better
for
our
clients
.
''
###
Big
indexer
Bankers
Trust
Co.
also
uses
futures
in
a
strategy
that
on
average
has
added
one
percentage
point
to
its
enhanced
fund
's
returns
.
###
J.
Thomas
Allen
,
president
of
Pittsburgh-based
Advanced
Investment
Management
Inc.
,
agrees
it
's
a
good
idea
to
jump
between
the
S&P
500
stocks
and
futures
.
###
``
You
're
buying
the
S&P
,
and
you
always
want
to
hold
the
cheapest
form
of
it
,
''
he
says
.
###
But
some
indexers
make
little
or
no
use
of
futures
,
saying
that
these
instruments
present
added
risks
for
investors
.
###
``
If
the
futures
markets
have
a
problem
,
then
those
products
could
have
a
problem
,
''
says
John
Zumbrunn
,
managing
director
of
Prudential
Insurance
Co.
of
America
's
Investment
Index
Technologies
Inc.
unit
.
###
Prudential
currently
is
seeking
approval
to
offer
a
new
fund
offering
a
return
equal
to
the
S&P
500
index
plus
of
a
percentage
point
.
###
An
added
feature
is
that
the
slighty
improved
return
would
be
guaranteed
by
Prudential
.
###
There
are
many
other
strategies
to
bolster
the
returns
of
index
funds
.
###
They
include
:
###
LIMITED
RISK
FUNDS
:
These
guarantee
protection
against
stock
market
declines
while
still
passing
along
most
gains
.
###
Here
a
fund
may
promise
to
pay
back
,
say
,
$
95
of
every
$
100
invested
for
a
year
,
even
if
the
market
goes
much
lower
.
###
The
fund
could
invest
$
87
for
one
year
in
Treasury
bills
yielding
8
%
to
return
the
guaranteed
$
95
.
###
That
leaves
$
13
,
which
could
be
used
to
buy
S&P
500
options
that
will
nearly
match
any
gain
in
the
S&P
index
.
###
MANAGER
REPLICATION
FUNDS
:
Say
a
big
investor
is
interested
in
growth
stocks
.
###
Instead
of
hiring
one
of
the
many
active
managers
specializing
in
growth
stocks
,
indexers
can
design
a
portfolio
around
the
same
stocks
;
the
portfolio
will
be
maintained
by
computer
,
reducing
both
fees
and
,
in
theory
,
risk
-LRB-
because
of
the
large
number
of
stocks
-RRB-
.
###
``
We
see
a
lot
of
interest
in
those
kind
of
things
,
''
says
Frank
Salerno
,
a
vice
president
of
Bankers
Trust
.
###
``
People
comfortable
with
the
passive
approach
are
using
them
for
other
strategies
.
''
###
TILT
FUNDS
:
This
is
an
index
fund
with
a
bet
.
###
Instead
of
replicating
the
S&P
500
or
some
other
index
exactly
,
some
stocks
are
overweighted
or
underweighted
in
the
portfolio
.
###
One
simple
approach
is
to
exclude
S&P
500
companies
considered
bankruptcy
candidates
;
this
can
avoid
weak
sisters
,
but
also
can
hurt
when
a
company
like
Chrysler
Corp.
rebounds
.
###
Another
approach
:
An
investor
with
$
100
million
might
use
$
75
million
to
buy
the
S&P
500
index
and
spend
the
other
$
25
million
on
a
favorite
group
of
stocks
.
###
SPECIALIZED
FUNDS
:
Indexes
can
be
constructed
to
serve
social
goals
,
such
as
eliminating
the
stocks
of
companies
doing
business
in
South
Africa
.
###
Other
funds
have
been
designed
to
concentrate
on
stocks
in
a
geographic
area
in
order
to
encourage
local
investment
.
###
Pennsylvania
State
Employees
Retirement
System
,
for
example
,
has
about
$
130
million
invested
in
a
fund
of
244
companies
that
are
either
Pennsylvania-based
or
have
25
%
of
their
work
forces
in
the
state
.
###
Short
interest
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
declined
for
the
second
consecutive
month
,
this
time
4.2
%
,
while
the
American
Stock
Exchange
reported
its
third
consecutive
record
month
of
short
interest
.
###
The
Big
Board
reported
that
short
interest
dropped
to
523,920,214
shares
as
of
Oct.
13
from
547,347,585
shares
in
mid-September
.
###
Amex
short
interest
climbed
3
%
to
53,496,665
shares
from
51,911,566
shares
.
###
For
the
year-earlier
month
,
the
Big
Board
reported
461,539,056
shares
,
indicating
a
13.5
%
year-to-year
rise
,
while
the
Amex
reported
36,015,194
shares
,
a
48
%
leap
.
###
Amex
short
interest
has
been
heading
upward
since
mid-December
,
with
increases
in
each
month
since
then
except
at
mid-July
.
###
Traders
who
sell
short
borrow
stock
and
sell
it
,
betting
that
the
stock
's
price
will
decline
and
that
they
can
buy
the
shares
back
later
at
a
lower
price
for
return
to
the
lender
.
###
Short
interest
is
the
number
of
shares
that
have
n't
yet
been
purchased
for
return
to
lenders
.
###
Although
a
substantial
short
position
reflects
heavy
speculation
that
a
stock
's
price
will
decline
,
some
investors
consider
an
increase
in
short
interest
bullish
because
the
borrowed
shares
eventually
must
be
bought
back
.
###
Fluctuation
in
short
interest
of
certain
stocks
also
may
be
caused
partly
by
arbitraging
.
###
The
figures
occasionally
include
incomplete
transactions
in
restricted
stock
.
###
The
level
of
negative
sentiment
measured
by
the
Big
Board
short
interest
ratio
slipped
to
3.36
from
last
month
's
3.38
.
###
The
ratio
is
the
number
of
trading
days
,
at
the
exchange
's
average
trading
volume
,
that
would
be
required
to
convert
the
total
short
interest
position
.
###
Some
analysts
suggest
,
however
,
that
the
ratio
has
weakened
in
value
as
an
indicator
because
options
and
other
products
can
be
used
to
hedge
short
positions
.
###
Varity
Corp.
led
the
Big
Board
list
of

###
Your
Oct.
12
editorial
``
Pitiful
,
Helpless
Presidency
?
''
correctly
states
that
I
was
critical
of
the
Bush
administration
's
failure
to
have
any
plan
in
place
to
respond
in
a
timely
fashion
to
the
opportunities
to
oust
Manuel
Noriega
presented
by
the
attempted
military
coup
on
Oct.
3
.
###
You
are
absolutely
wrong
,
however
,
in
opining
that
this
position
is
some
kind
of
``
flip-flop
,
''
something
newly
arrived
at
as
a
result
of
reading
the
opinion
polls
.
###
My
position
is
one
founded
on
both
the
facts
and
the
law
.
###
Although
you
may
have
forgotten
,
public
opinion
about
Gen.
Noriega
is
where
it
is
in
large
measure
because
of
my
investigation
of
his
years
of
involvement
in
narcotics
smuggling
-LRB-
and
simultaneous
work
as
a
U.S.
operative
-RRB-
.
###
The
public
made
up
its
mind
about
Gen.
Noriega
largely
as
a
result
of
the
hearings
I
chaired
in
the
Subcommittee
on
Terrorism
and
Narcotics
of
the
Foreign
Relations
Committee
on
Feb.
8
,
9
,
10
and
11
,
1988
,
and
again
on
April
4
,
1988
.
###
It
was
during
those
hearings
that
the
nation
first
learned
the
breadth
and
depth
of
Gen.
Noriega
's
criminality
,
and
of
his
enduring
relationships
with
a
variety
of
U.S.
government
agencies
.
###
Those
hearings
also
highlighted
how
Gen.
Noriega
was
able
to
use
his
relationships
with
these
agencies
to
delay
U.S.
action
against
him
,
and
to
exploit
the
administration
's
obsession
with
overthrowing
the
Sandinistas
to
protect
his
own
drug-dealing
.
###
As
former
Ambassador
to
Costa
Rica
Francis
J.
McNeil
testified
before
the
subcommittee
,
the
Reagan
administration
knew
that
Gen.
Noriega
was
involved
with
narcotics
,
but
made
a
decision
in
the
summer
of
1986
``
to
put
Gen.
Noriega
on
the
shelf
until
Nicaragua
was
settled
.
''
###
As
the
report
issued
by
the
subcommittee
concluded
,
``
Our
government
did
nothing
regarding
Gen.
Noriega
's
drug
business
and
substantial
criminal
involvement
because
the
first
priority
was
the
Contra
war
.
###
This
decision
resulted
in
at
least
some
drugs
entering
the
United
States
as
a
hidden
cost
of
the
war
.
''
###
Unfortunately
,
this
problem
continued
even
after
Gen.
Noriega
's
indictment
.
###
Throughout
1988
and
this
year
,
I
and
others
in
Congress
have
pressed
the
U.S.
to
develop
a
plan
for
pushing
this
``
narcokleptocrat
''
out
of
Panama
.
###
Regrettably
,
two
administrations
in
a
row
have
been
unwilling
and
unable
to
develop
any
plan
,
military
or
economic
,
for
supporting
the
Panamanian
people
in
their
attempts
to
restore
democracy
.

###
For
Vietnamese
,
these
are
tricky
,
often
treacherous
,
times
.
###
After
years
of
hesitation
,
economic
and
political
reform
was
embraced
at
the
end
of
1986
,
but
ringing
declarations
have
yet
to
be
translated
into
much
action
.
###
Vietnam
is
finding
that
turning
a
stagnant
socialist
order
into
a
dynamic
free
market
does
n't
come
easy
.
###
Here
is
how
three
Vietnamese
are
coping
with
change
:

living
proof
that
old
ways
die
hard
.
###
Mr.
Chan
used
to
be
an
oddity
in
Hanoi
:
a
private
entrepreneur
.
###
His
business
success
made
him
an
official
target
in
pre-reform
days
.
###
Mr.
Chan
,
now
64
years
old
,
invented
a
fountain
pen
he
and
his
family
produced
from
plastic
waste
.
###
Later
,
he
marketed
glue
.
###
Both
products
were
immensely
popular
.
###
For
his
troubles
,
Mr.
Chan
was
jailed
three
times
between
1960
and
1974
.
###
Though
his
operation
was
registered
and
used
only
scrap
,
he
was
accused
of
conducting
illegal
business
and
possessing
illegal
materials
.
###
Once
he
was
held
for
three
months
without
being
charged
.
###
Things
were
supposed
to
change
when
Vietnam
's
economic
reforms
gathered
pace
,
and
for
awhile
they
did
.
###
After
years
of
experimenting
,
Mr.
Chan
produced
a
heavy-duty
bicycle
tire
that
outlasted
its
state-produced
rival
.
###
By
1982
,
he
was
selling
thousands
of
tires
.
###
Newspapers
published
articles
about
him
,
and
he
was
hailed
as
``
the
tire
king
.
''
###
His
efforts
earned
a
gold
medal
at
a
national
exhibition
--
and
attracted
renewed
attention
from
local
authorities
.
###
District
police
in
1983
descended
on
his
suburban
home
,
which
he
and
his
large
family
used
as
both
residence
and
factory
,
and
demanded
proof
the
house
and
equipment
were
his
.
###
He
produced
it
.
###
``
That
was
the
first
time
they
lost
and
I
won
,
''
he
says
.
###
He
was
further
questioned
to
determine
if
he
was
``
a
real
working
man
or
an
exploiter
.
''
###
Says
Mr.
Chan
:
``
When
I
showed
it
was
from
my
own
brain
,
they
lost
for
the
second
time
.
''
###
But
a
few
days
later
the
police
accused
him
of
stealing
electricity
,
acquiring
rubber
without
permission
and
buying
stolen
property
.
###
Warned
he
was
to
be
jailed
again
,
he
fled
to
the
countryside
.
###
His
family
was
given
three
hours
to
leave
before
the
house
and
contents
were
confiscated
.
###
With
only
the
clothes
they
were
wearing
,
family
members
moved
to
a
home
owned
by
one
of
Mr.
Chan
's
sons
.
###
After
six
months
on
the
run
,
Mr.
Chan
learned
the
order
for
his
arrest
had
been
canceled
.
###
He
rejoined
his
family
in
January
1984
and
began
the
long
struggle
for
justice
,
pressing
everyone
from
Hanoi
municipal
officials
to
National
Assembly
deputies
for
restoration
of
his
rights
.
###
He
and
his
family
kept
afloat
by
repairing
bicycles
,
selling
fruit
and
doing
odd
jobs
.
###
Mr.
Chan
achieved
a
breakthrough
in
1987
--
and
became
a
minor
celebrity
again
--
when
his
story
was
published
in
a
weekly
newspaper
.
###
In
1988
,
18
months
after
the
sixth
congress
formally
endorsed
family-run
private
enterprise
,
district
authorities
allowed
Mr.
Chan
to
resume
work
.
###
By
late
last
year
he
was
invited
back
as
``
the
tire
king
''
to
display
his
products
at
a
national
exhibition
.
###
National
leaders
stopped
by
his
stand
to
commend
his
achievements
.
###
Mr.
Chan
now
produces
1,000
bicycle
and
motorbike
tires
a
month
and
1,000
tins
of
tire-patching
glue
in
the
son
's
small
house
.
###
Eighteen
people
pack
the
house
's
two
rooms
--
the
Chans
,
four
of
their
10
children
with
spouses
,
and
eight
of
22
grandchildren
.
###
Most
sleep
on
the
floor
.
###
Come
daybreak
,
eight
family
members
and
two
other
workers
unroll
a
sheet
of
raw
rubber
that
covers
the
floor
of
the
house
and
spills
out
onto
the
street
.
###
The
primitive
operations
also
burst
out
the
back
door
into
a
small
courtyard
,
where
an
ancient
press
squeezes
rubber
solution
into
a
flat
strip
and
newly
made
tires
are
cooled
in
a
bathtub
filled
with
water
.
###
Mr.
Chan
talks
optimistically
of
expanding
,
maybe
even
moving
into
the
import-export
field
.
###
First
,
however
,
he
has
unfinished
business
.
###
When
district
authorities
allowed
him
to
resume
manufacturing
,
they
released
only
one
of
his
machines
.
###
They
did
n't
return
the
rubber
stocks
that
represent
his
capital
.
###
Nor
did
they
return
his
house
and
contents
,
which
he
values
at
about
$
44,000
.
###
He
wants
to
recover
more
than
just
his
property
,
though
.
###
``
I
want
my
dignity
back
,
''
he
says
.
###
Nguyen
Ngoc
seemed
an
obvious
choice
when
the
Vietnamese
Writers
Association
was
looking
for
a
new
editor
to
reform
its
weekly
newspaper
,
Van
Nghe
.
###
After
the
sixth
congress
,
journalists
seized
the
opportunity
provided
by
the
liberalization
to
probe
previously
taboo
subjects
.
###
Mr.
Ngoc
,
57
years
old
,
had
solid
reformist
credentials
:
He
had
lost
his
official
position
in
the
association
in
he
early
1980s
because
he
questioned
the
intrusion
of
politics
into
literature
.
###
Appointed
editor
in
chief
in
July
1987
,
Mr.
Ngoc
rapidly
turned
the
staid
Van
Nghe
into
Vietnam
's
hottest
paper
.
###
Circulation
soared
as
the
weekly
went
way
beyond
standard
literary
themes
to
cover
Vietnamese
society
and
its
ills
.
###
Readers
were
electrified
by
the
paper
's
audacity
and
appalled
by
the
dark
side
of
life
it
uncovered
.
###
One
article
recounted
a
decade-long
struggle
by
a
wounded
soldier
to
prove
,
officially
,
he
was
alive
.
###
Another
described
how
tax-collection
officials
in
Thanh
Hoa
province
one
night
stormed
through
homes
and
confiscated
rice
from
starving
villagers
.
###
The
newspaper
also
ran
a
series
of
controversial
short
stories
by
Nguyen
Huy
Thiep
,
a
former
history
teacher
,
who
stirred
debate
over
his
interpretation
of
Vietnamese
culture
and
took
a
thinly
veiled
swipe
at
writers
who
had
blocked
his
entry
into
their
official
association
.
###
Van
Nghe
quickly
made
influential
enemies
.
###
``
Those
who
manage
ideology
and
a
large
number
of
writers
reacted
badly
''
to
the
restyled
paper
,
says
Lai
Nguyen
An
,
a
literary
critic
.
###
After
months
of
internal
rumblings
,
Mr.
Ngoc
was
fired
last
December
.
###
His
dismissal
triggered
a
furor
among
intellectuals
that
continues
today
.
###
``
Under
Mr.
Ngoc
,
Van
Nghe
protected
the
people
instead
of
the
government
,
''
says
Nguyen
Duy
,
a
poet
who
is
the
paper
's
bureau
chief
for
southern
Vietnam
.
###
``
The
paper
reflected
the
truth
.
###
For
the
leadership
,
that
was
too
painful
to
bear
.
''
###
The
`
Billionaire
'
###
Nguyen
Thi
Thi
is
Vietnam
's
entrepreneur
of
the
1980s
.
###
Her
challenge
is
to
keep
her
fledgling
empire
on
top
in
the
1990s
.
###
Mrs.
Thi
did
n't
wait
for
the
reforms
to
get
her
start
.
###
She
charged
ahead
of
the
government
and
the
law
to
establish
Hochiminh
City
Food
Co.
as
the
biggest
rice
dealer
in
the
country
.
###
Her
success
,
which
included
alleviating
an
urban
food
shortage
in
the
early
1980s
,
helped
persuade
Hanoi
to
take
the
reform
path
.
###
Her
story
is
becoming
part
of
local
folklore
.
###
A
lifelong
revolutionary
with
little
education
who
fought
both
the
French
and
the
U.S.-backed
Saigon
regime
,
she
switched
effortlessly
to
commerce
after
the
war
.
###
Her
instincts
were
capitalistic
,
despite
her
background
.
###
As
she
rode
over
regulations
,
only
her
friendship
with
party
leaders
,
including
Nguyen
Van
Linh
,
then
Ho
Chi
Minh
City
party
secretary
,
kept
her
out
of
jail
.
###
Following
Mr.
Linh
's
appointment
as
secretary-general
of
the
party
at
the
sixth
congress
,
Mrs.
Thi
has
become
the
darling
of
``
doi
moi
''
,
the
Vietnamese
version
of
perestroika
.
###
The
authorities
have
steered
foreign
reporters
to
her
office
to
see
an
example
of
``
the
new
way
of
thinking
.
''
###
Foreign
publications
have
responded
with
articles
declaring
her
Vietnam
's
richest
woman
.
###
``
Some
people
call
me
the
communist
billionaire
,
''
she
has
told
visitors
.
###
Actually
,
67-year-old
Mrs.
Thi
is
about
as
poor
as
almost
everyone
else
in
this
impoverished
land
.
###
She
has
indeed
turned
Hochiminh
City
Food
into
a
budding
conglomerate
,
but
the
company
itself
remains
state-owned
.
###
She
manages
it
with
the
title
of
general-director
.
###
The
heart
of
the
business
is
the
purchase
of
rice
and
other
commodities
,
such
as
corn
and
coffee
,
from
farmers
in
the
south
,
paying
with
fertilizer
,
farm
tools
and
other
items
.
###
Last
year
,
Hochiminh
City
Food
says
it
bought
two
million
metric
tons
of
unhusked
rice
,
more
than
10
%
of
the
country
's
output
.
###
The
company
operates
a
fleet
of
trucks
and
boats
to
transport
the
commodities
to
its
warehouses
.
###
A
subsidiary
company
processes
commodities
into
foods
such
as
instant
noodles
that
are
sold
with
the
rice
through
a
vast
retail
network
.
###
In
recent
years
,
Mrs.
Thi
has
started
to
diversify
the
company
,
taking
a
20
%
stake
in
newly
established
,
partly
private
Industrial
and
Commercial
Bank
,
and
setting
up
Saigon
Petro
,
which
owns
and
operates
Vietnam
's
first
oil
refinery
.
###
Mrs.
Thi
says
Hochiminh
City
Food
last
year
increased
pretax
profit
60
%
to
the
equivalent
of
about
$
2.7
million
on
sales
of
$
150
million
.
###
She
expects
both
revenue
and
profit
to
gain
this
year
.
###
She
is
almost
cavalier
about
the
possibility
Vietnam
's
reforms
will
create
rivals
on
her
home
turf
.
###
``
I
do
n't
mind
the
competition
inside
the
country
,
''
she
says
.
###
``
I
am
only
afraid
that
with
Vietnam
's
poor-quality
products
we
ca
n't
compete
with
neighboring
countries
.
###
The
earthquake
that
hit
the
San
Francisco
Bay
area
is
n't
likely
to
result
in
wholesale
downgrading
of
bond
ratings
,
officials
at
the
two
major
rating
agencies
said
.
###
Standard
&
Poor
's
Corp.
is
reviewing
debt
issued
by
12
California
counties
,
and
``
there
are
potential
isolated
problems
,
''
said
Hyman
Grossman
,
a
managing
director
.
###
The
agency
is
preparing
a
report
,
to
be
issued
today
,
on
the
earthquake
's
impact
on
the
and
casualty-insurance
industry
.
###
The
only
securities
so
far
to
be
singled
out
are
those
issued
by
Bay
View
Federal
Savings
&
Loan
.
###
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
said
it
is
reviewing
,
with
an
eye
toward
a
possible
downgrade
,
the
ratings
on
Bay
View
Federal
bonds
,
long-term
deposits
and
the
preferred-stock
rating
of
its
parent
company
,
Bay
View
Capital
Corp
.
###
As
for
property
and
casualty
insurers
,
Moody
's
said
``
preliminary
estimates
suggest
that
losses
should
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
most
insurers
'
financial
condition
,
''
but
it
``
raises
concerns
about
potentially
substantial
risks
''
longer-term
.
###
``
Losses
from
the
earthquake
are
expected
to
be
of
similar
magnitude
to
those
of
Hurricane
Hugo
,
''
according
to
Moody
's
.
###
Your
Oct.
5
editorial
``
A
Democratic
Tax
Cut
''
contained
an
error
.
###
In
the
third
paragraph
it
referred
to
the
senators
seeking
loophole
suggestions
from
lobbyists
for
various
sectors
of
the
economy
.
###
Among
them
,
``
banana
farmers
.
''
###
The
only
significant
commercial
banana
farmers
in
the
U.S.
are
in
Hawaii
.
###
The
Hawaii
Banana
Industry
Association
,
to
which
nearly
all
of
them
belong
,
has
no
lobbyist
.
###
Thomas
V.
Reese
Sr
.
###
Maui
Banana
Co
.
###
Western
Digital
Corp.
reported
a
net
loss
of
$
2.7
million
,
or
nine
cents
a
share
,
for
its
first
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
,
citing
factors
as
varied
as
hurricane
damage
,
an
advance
in
graphics
technology
and
the
strengthening
dollar
.
###
In
the
year-ago
period
,
the
company
earned
$
12.9
million
,
or
45
cents
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
247
million
.
###
Sales
for
the
just-ended
period
fell
to
about
$
225
million
,
the
maker
of
computer
parts
said
.
###
Nonetheless
,
Chairman
Roger
W.
Johnson
said
he
expects
the
company
to
be
profitable
in
the
current
quarter
.
###
``
We
are
positioned
to
come
through
,
''
he
said
,
noting
that
the
company
's
backlog
was
up
from
the
previous
quarter
.
###
In
its
second
quarter
last
year
,
Western
Digital
earned
$
12.7
million
,
or
44
cents
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
258.4
million
.
###
Mr.
Johnson
said
Western
Digital
's
plant
in
Puerto
Rico
was
affected
by
Hurricane
Hugo
,
losing
three
days
'
production
because
of
the
storm
,
which
wrecked
much
of
the
Caribbean
island
's
infrastructure
.
###
Although
the
plant
itself
was
n't
damaged
,
Mr.
Johnson
said
millions
of
dollars
in
first-quarter
revenue
were
lost
.
###
The
revenue
will
be
regained
in
the
current
period
,
he
added
.
###
There
are
no
plans
to
initiate
a
common
stock
dividend
,
Mr.
Johnson
said
,
explaining
that
the
board
continues
to
believe
shareholders
are
best
served
by
reinvesting
excess
cash
.
###
Mr.
Johnson
said
the
first-quarter
loss
also
heavily
reflected
a
rapid
change
in
graphics
technology
that
left
reseller
channels
with
too
many
of
the
old
computer
graphics
boards
and
too
few
new
monitors
compatible
with
the
new
graphics
boards
.
###
Western
Digital
does
n't
make
the
monitors
.
###
An
accelerating
move
by
personal
computer
manufacturers
'
to
include
advanced
graphics
capabilities
as
standard
equipment
further
dampened
reseller
purchases
of
Western
Digital
's
equipment
.
###
``
The
other
areas
of
the
business
--
storage
and
microcomputers
--
were
very
good
,
''
Mr.
Johnson
said
.
###
He
said
Western
Digital
has
reacted
swiftly
to
the
movement
to
video
graphics
array
,
VGA
,
graphics
technology
from
the
old
enhanced
graphics
adapter
,
EGA
,
which
has
a
lower
resolution
standard
,
technology
and
now
is
one
of
the
leading
producers
of
these
newer
units
.
###
Other
makers
of
video
controller
equipment
also
were
caught
in
the
EGA-VGA
shift
,
he
said
,
``
but
we
were
able
to
respond
much
more
quickly
.
''
###
Still
,
Mr.
Johnson
said
,
``
our
stock
is
grossly
undervalued
.
''
###
He
said
the
company
has
cut
operating
expenses
by
about
10
%
over
the
last
few
quarters
,
while
maintaining
research
and
development
at
about
8
%
to
9
%
of
sales
.
###
As
part
of
its
reorganization
this
week
,
Western
Digital
has
divided
its
business
into
two
segments
--
storage
products
,
including
controllers
and
disk
drives
;
and
microcomputer
products
,
which
include
graphics
,
communications
and
peripheral
control
chips
.
###
Graphics
,
communications
and
peripheral
control
chips
were
combined
because
,
increasingly
,
multiple
functions
are
being
governed
by
a
single
chip
.
###
Storage
,
which
includes
computer
controllers
and
3.5-inch
disk
drives
,
represents
nearly
two-thirds
of
the
company
's
business
.
###
Disk
drives
,
which
allow
a
computer
to
access
its
memory
,
generated
38
%
more
revenue
in
the
most
recent
period
compared
with
the
fiscal
first
quarter
a
year
earlier
.
###
Computer
parts
are
getting
ever
smaller
,
Mr.
Johnson
said
,
a
shrinking
that
has
propelled
laptops
into
position
as
the
fastest-growing
segment
of
the
computer
business
.
###
As
smaller
and
more
powerful
computers
continue
to
be
the
focus
of
the
industry
,
he
said
,
Western
Digital
is
strengthening
development
of
laptop
parts
.
###
Next
year
Western
Digital
plans
to
consolidate
its
operations
from
11
buildings
in
Irvine
into
two
buildings
in
the
same
citya
new
headquarters
and
,
a
block
away
,
a
modern
$
100
million
silicon
wafer
fabrication
plant
.
###
The
plan
will
help
the
company
in
its
existing
joint
manufacturing
agreement
with
AT&T
.
###
About
half
of
Western
Digital
's
business
is
overseas
,
and
Mr.
Johnson
expects
that
proportion
to
continue
.
###
Plans
to
dissolve
many
of
the
trade
barriers
within
Europe
in
1992
creates
significant
opportunities
for
the
company
,
he
said
,
particularly
since
Western
Digital
already
manufactures
there
.
###
Capitalizing
on
that
presence
,
Western
Digital
is
launching
a
major
effort
to
develop
the
embryonic
reseller
market
in
Europe
.
###
Directors
of
state-owned
Banca
Nazionale
del
Lavoro
approved
a
two-step
capital-boosting
transaction
and
a
change
in
the
bank
's
rules
that
will
help
it
operate
more
like
a
private-sector
institution
.
###
Until
now
,
BNL
's
top
managers
and
its
directors
have
been
appointed
by
a
Treasury
decree
.
###
But
under
the
bank
's
proposed
statutes
,
an
assembly
of
shareholders
must
approve
board
members
.
###
The
bank
's
chairman
and
director
general
,
who
also
sit
on
the
board
,
still
would
be
appointed
by
the
Treasury
.
###
BNL
,
which
is
controlled
by
the
Italian
Treasury
,
was
rocked
by
the
disclosure
last
month
that
its
Atlanta
branch
extended
more
than
$
3
billion
in
unauthorized
credits
to
Iraq
.
###
The
ensuing
scandal
,
in
which
the
bank
's
management
resigned
,
has
helped
renew
calls
for
privatization
,
or
at
least
an
overhaul
,
of
Italy
's
banking
system
,
which
is
about
80
%
state-controlled
.
###
In
a
related
move
,
the
bank
also
proposed
that
board
representation
be
linked
more
closely
to
the
bank
's
new
shareholding
structure
.
###
BNL
called
a
shareholders
'
assembly
meeting
in
December
to
vote
on
the
proposals
.
###
BNL
has
about
75,000
nonvoting
shares
that
are
listed
on
the
Milan
Stock
Exchange
.
###
The
shares
were
suspended
from
trading
following
disclosure
of
the
Atlanta
scandal
;
Consob
,
the
stock
exchange
regulatory
body
,
reportedly
will
decide
soon
whether
to
end
the
trading
suspension
.

###
The

the

largely
to
higher

###
A

As

Hunt
brothers

cases
sputter

Minpeco
S.A.
has
proposed

deal
to
settle
its
huge
claim
against
the
troubled
Texas
oil
men
.
###
But
the
plan
only
threatens
to
heighten
the
tension
and
confusion
already
surrounding
the
cases
that
were
filed
in
September
1988
.
###
The
Peruvian
mineral
concern
's
$
251
million
claim
stems
from
1988
jury
award
in
a
case
stemming
from
the
brothers
'
alleged
attempts
to
corner
the
1979-80
silver
market
.
###
Minpeco
now
says
it
is
willing
to
settle
for
up
to
$
65.7
million
from
each
brother
,
although
the
actual
amount
would
probably
be
much
less
.
###
Although
the
proposal
must
be
approved
by
federal
Judge
Harold
C.
Abramson
,
W.
Herbert
Hunt
has
agreed
to
the
Peruvian
mineral
concern
's
proposal
.
###
Nelson
Bunker
Hunt
is
considering
it
,
although
his
attorney
says
he
wo
n't
do
it
if
the
proposal
jeopardizes
a
tentative
settlement
he
has
reached
with
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
,
which
claims
the
brothers
owe
$
1
billion
in
back
taxes
and
is
by
far
the
biggest
creditor
in
both
cases
.
###
The
tentative
agreement
between
the
IRS
and
Nelson
Bunker
Hunt
is
awaiting
U.S.
Justice
Department
approval
.
###
Under
it
,
the
former
billionaire
's
assets
would
be
liquidated
with
the
IRS
getting
80
%
of
the
proceeds
and
the
rest
being
divided
among
other
creditors
,
including
Minpeco
and
Manufacturers
Hanover
Trust
Co.
,
which
is
seeking
repayment
of
a
$
36
million
loan
.
###
A
similiar
proposal
has
been
made
in
the
W.
Herbert
Hunt
case
although
he
and
the
IRS
are
at
odds
over
the
size
of
the
non-dischargable
debt
he
would
have
to
pay
to
the
government
from
future
earnings
.
###
In
both
cases
,
Minpeco
and
Manufacturers
Hanover
have
been
fighting
ferociously
over
their
shares
of
the
pie
.
###
With
support
from
the
IRS
,
Manufacturers
Hanover
has
filed
suit
asking
Judge
Abramson
to
subordinate
Minpeco
's
claim
to
those
of
Manufacturer
Hanover
and
the
IRS
.
###
Minpeco
has
threatened
a
``
volcano
''
of
litigation
if
the
Manufacturers
Hanover
Corp.
unit
attempts
to
force
such
a
plan
through
the
court
.
###
Minpeco
said
it
would
n't
pursue
such
litigation
if
its
settlement
plan
in
the
W.
Herbert
Hunt
case
is
approved
by
Judge
Abramson
,
who
will
consider
the
proposal
at
a
hearing
next
week
.
###
Minpeco
attorney
Thomas
Gorman
decribed
the
plan
as
one
step
toward
an
overall
settlement
of
the
W.
Herbert
Hunt
case
but
Hugh
Ray
,
attorney
for
Manufacturers
Hanover
,
called
it
``
silly
''
and
said
he
would
fight
it
in
court
.
###
``
The
thing
is
so
fluid
right
now
that
there
's
really
no
way
to
say
what
will
happen
,

says
Justice
Department
attorney
Grover
Hartt
III

who
represents
the
IRS
in
the
case
.
###
``
Developments

this

Banc

Toledo

Ohio
,
following
the
planned
merger

Ottawa
counties
in

Ohio
have
total
assets
of
about

88
million
,
Banc

###
The
purchase
price
will
be
established
after
Banc
One
has
an
opportunity
to
study
the
quality
of
the
assets
,
Banc
One
said
.
###
Society
Corp.
already
has
branches
in
the
area
,
and
selling
the
Trustcorp
offices
could
avoid
a
problem
with
regulators
over
excessive
concentration
of
banking
in
the
two
counties
after
the
merger
of

Stock-market
fears
and
relatively
more
attractive
interest
rates
pushed
money-market
mutual
fund
assets
up
$
6.07
billion
in
the
latest
week
,
the
sharpest
increase
in
almost
two

###
The
$
6.07

increase
was
the
strongest
weekly
inflow
since
January
1988
.
###
The
increase
was
spread
fairly
evenly
among
all
three
types
of
funds
.
###
Individual
investors

said
Jacob
Dreyer
,
vice
president
and
chief
economist
of
the
Institute
.
###
``
Insitutional
investors

decline
last
Friday
,
''
Mr.
Dreyer
said

###
Yields
on

dropped
in

week
ended
Tuesday
,
according

Donoghue
's
Money
Fund

The

###
Domestic
lending
for
real
estate
and
property
development
was
the
source
of
Bank
Bumiputra
Malaysia
Bhd.
's
most
recent
spate
of
financial
troubles
,
the
institution
's
executive
chairman
,
Mohamed
Basir
Ismail
,
said
.
###
Speaking
to
reporters
this
week
after
Bank
Bumiputra
's
shareholders
approved
a
rescue
plan
,
Tan
Sri
Basir
said
heavy
lending
to
the
property
sector
rocked
the
bank
when
property
prices
in
Malaysia
plummeted
in
1984-85
.
###
He
said
the
bank
could
n't
wait
any
longer
for
prices
to
recover
and
for
borrowers
to
service
their
loans
.
###
So
the
bank
's
board
decided
to
make
1.23
billion
Malaysian
dollars
-LRB-
US$
457
million
-RRB-
in
provisions
for
interest
payments
from
loans
previously
recorded
as
revenue
but
never
actually
received
by
the
bank
,
and
to
submit
a
bailout
package
to
replenish
the
bank
's
paid-up
capital
.
###
The
predicament
,
he
added
,
was
similar
to
the
Hong
Kong
1982-83
property-price
collapse
,
which
exposed
the
involvement
of
Bank
Bumiputra
's
former
subsidiary
in
the
colony
in
the
largest
banking
scandal
in
Malaysia
's
history
.
###
The
subsidiary
,
Bumiputra
Malaysia
Finance
Ltd.
,
was
left
with
M$
2.26
billion
in
bad
loans
made
to
Hong
Kong
property
speculators
.
###
Both
episodes
wiped
out
Bank
Bumiputra
's
shareholders

funds

Each
time
,
the
bank
's
90
%
shareholder
--
Petroliam
Nasional
Bhd.
,
or
Petronas
,
the
national
oil
company
--
has
been
called
upon
to
rescue
the
institution
.
###
In
five
years
,
Petronas
,
which
became
the
dominant
shareholder
in
a
1984
rescue
exercise
,
has
spent
about
M$
3.5
billion
to
prop
up
the
troubled
bank
.
###
Tan
Sri
Basir
said
the
capital
restructuring
plan
has
been
approved
by
Malaysia
's
Capital
Issues
Committee
and
central
bank
.
###
Malaysia
's
High
Court
is
expected
to
approve
the
plan
.
###
Once
the
plan
is
approved
,
Tan
Sri
Basir
said
,
most
of
Bank
Bumiputra
's
nonperforming
loans
will
have
been
fully
provided
for
and
the
bank
will
be
on
track
to
report
a
pretax
profit
of
between
M$
160
million
and
M$
170
million
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
March
31
.
###
For
the
previous
financial
year
,
the
bank
would
have
reported
a
pretax
profit
of
M$
168
million
if
it
had
n't
made
provisions
for
the
nonperforming
loans
,
he
said
.
###
Malaysia
's
Banking
Secrecy
Act
prohibited
the
bank
from
identifying
delinquent
borrowers
,
said
Tan
Sri
Basir
.
###
But
public
documents
indicate
10
%
or
more
of
the
bank
's
provisions
were
made
for
foregone
interest
on
a
M$
200
million
loan
to
Malaysia
's
dominant
political
party
,
the
United
Malays
National
Organization
,
to
build
its
convention
and
headquarters
complex
in
Kuala
Lumpur
.
###
The
loan
to
UMNO
was
made
in
September
1983
.
###
``
We
lent
a
lot
of
money
all
over
the
place
,
''
said
Tan
Sri
Basir
,
who
refused
to
discuss
the
bank
's
outstanding
loans
to
###
As
well
as
the
M$
1.23
billion
in
provisions
announced
on
Oct.
6
,
the
restructuring
package
covers
an
additional
M$
450
million
in
provisions
made
in
earlier
years
but
never
reflected
in
a
reduction
of
the
bank
's
paid-up
capital
.
###
At
the
end
of
the
exercise
,
the
cash
injection
from
Petronas
will
increase
the
bank
's
paid-up
capital
to
M$
1.15
billion
after
virtually
being
wiped
out
by
the
new
provisions
.
###
Heidi
Ehman
might
have
stepped
from
a
recruiting
poster
for
young
Republicans
.
###
White
,
24
years
old
,
a
singer
in
her
church
choir
,
she
symbolizes
a
generation
that
gave
its
heart
and
its
vote
to
Ronald
Reagan
.
###
``
I
felt
kind
of
safe
,
''
she
says
.
###
No
longer
.
###
When
the
Supreme
Court
opened
the
door
this
year
to
new
restrictions
on
abortion
,
Ms.
Ehman
opened
her
mind
to
Democratic
politics
.
###
Then
a
political
novice
,
she
stepped
into
a
whirl
of
``
pro-choice
''
marches
,
house
parties
and
fund-raisers
.
###
Now
she
leads
a
grassroots
abortion-rights
campaign
in
Passaic
County
for
pro-choice
Democratic
gubernatorial
candidate
James
Florio
.
###
``
This
is
one
where
I
cross
party
lines
,
''
she
says
,
rejecting
the
anti-abortion
stance
of
Rep.
Florio
's
opponent
,
Reagan-Republican
Rep.
James
Courter
.
###
``
People
my
age
thought
it
was
n't
going
to
be
an
issue
.
###
Now
it
has
--
especially
for
people
my
age
.
''
###
Polls
bear
out
this
warning
,
but
after
a
decade
of
increased
Republican
influence
here
,
the
new
politics
of
abortion
have
contributed
to
a
world
turned
upside
down
for
Mr.
Courter
.
###
Unless
he
closes
the
gap
,
Republicans
risk
losing
not
only
the
governorship
but
also
the
assembly
next
month
.
###
Going
into
the
1990s
,
the
GOP
is
paying
a
price
for
the
same
conservative
social
agenda
that
it
used
to
torment
Democrats
in
the
past
.
###
This
change
comes
less
from
a
shift
in
public
opinion
,
which
has
n't
changed
much
on
abortion
over
the
past
decade
,
than
in
the
boundaries
of
the
debate
.
###
New
Jersey
's
own
highest
court
remains
a
liberal
bulwark
against
major
restrictions
on
abortion
,
but
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
ruling
,
Webster
vs.
Missouri
,
has
engaged
voters
across
the
nation
who
had
been
insulated
from
the
issue
.
###
Before
July
,
pro-choice
voters
could
safely
make
political
decisions
without
focusing
narrowly
on
abortion
.
###
Now
,
the
threat
of
further
restrictions
adds
a
new
dimension
,
bringing
an
upsurge
in
political
activity
by
abortion-rights
forces
.
###
A
recent
pro-choice
rally
in
Trenton
drew
thousands
,
and
in
a
major
reversal
,
Congress
is
defying
a
presidential
veto
and
demanding
that
Medicaid
abortions
be
permitted
in
cases
of
rape
and
incest
.
###
``
If
Webster
had
n't
happened
,
you
would
n't
be
here
,
''
Linda
Bowker
tells
a
reporter
in
the
Trenton
office
of
the
National
Organization
for
Women
.
###
``
We
could
have
shouted
from
the
rooftops
about
Courter...
and
no
one
would
have
heard
us
.
''
###
New
Jersey
is
a
proving
ground
for
this
aggressive
women's-rights
movement
this
year
.
###
The
infusion
of
activists
can
bring
a
clash
of
cultures
.
###
In
Cherry
Hill
,
the
National
Abortion
Rights
Action
League
,
whose
goal
is
to
sign
up
50,000
pro-choice
voters
,
targets
a
union
breakfast
to
build
labor
support
for
its
cause
.
###
The
league
organizers
seem
more
a
fit
with
a
convention
next
door
of
young
aerobics
instructors
in
leotards
than
the
beefy
union
leaders
;
``
I
wish
I
could
go
work
out
,
''
says
a
slim
activist
.
###
A
labor
chief
speaks
sardonically
of
having
to
``
man
and
woman
''
Election
Day
phones
.
###
No
age
group
is
more
sensitive
than
younger
voters
,
like
Ms.
Ehman
.
###
A
year
ago
this
fall
,
New
Jersey
voters
under
30
favored
George
Bush
by
56
%
to
39
%
over
Michael
Dukakis
,
according
to
a
survey
then
by
Rutgers
University
's
Eagleton
Institute
.
###
A
matching
Eagleton-Newark
Star
Ledger
poll
last
month
showed
a
complete
reversal
.
###
Voters
in
the
same
age
group
backed
Democrat
Florio
55
%
to
29
%
over
Republican
Courter
.
###
Abortion
alone
ca
n't
explain
this
shift
,
but
New
Jersey
is
a
model
of
how
so
personal
an
issue
can
become
a
baseline
of
sorts
in
judging
a
candidate
.
###
By
a
2-to-1
ratio
,
voters
appear
more
at
ease
with
Mr.
Florio
's
stance
on
abortion
,
and
polls
indicate
his
lead
widens
when
the
candidates
are
specifically
linked
to
the
issue
.
###
``
The
times
are
my
times
,
''
says
Mr.
Florio
.
###
The
Camden
County
congressman
still
carries
himself
with
a
trademark
``
I'm-coming-down-your-throat
''
intensity
,
but
at
a
pause
in
Newark
's
Columbus
Day
parade
recently
,
he
was
dancing
with
his
wife
in
the
middle
of
the
avenue
in
the
city
's
old
Italian-American
ward
.
###
After
losing
by
fewer
than
1,800
votes
in
the
1981
governor
's
race
,
he
has
prepared
himself
methodically
for
this
moment
,
including
deciding
in
recent
years
he
could
no
longer
support
curbs
on
federal
funding
for
Medicaid
abortions
.
###
``
If
you
're
going
to
be
consistent
and
say
it
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right
,
''
he
asks
,
``
how
are
you
going
to
say
an
upscale
woman
who
can
drive
to
the
hospital
or
clinic
in
a
nice
car
has
a
constitutional
right
and
someone
who
is
not
in
great
shape
financially
does
not
?
''
###
Mr.
Courter
,
by
comparison
,
seems
a
shadow
of
the
confident
hawk
who
defended
Oliver
North
before
national
cameras
at
Iran-Contra
hearings
two
years
ago
.
###
Looking
back
,
he
says
he
erred
by
stating
his
``
personal
''
opposition
to
abortion
instead
of
assuring
voters
that
he
would
n't
impose
his
views
on
``
policy
''
as
governor
.
###
It
is
a
distinction
that
satisfies
neither
side
in
the
debate
.
###
``
He
does
n't
know
himself
,
''
Kathy
Stanwick
of
the
Abortion
Rights
League
says
of
Mr.
Courter
's
position
.
###
Even
abortion
opponents
,
however
angry
with
Mr.
Florio
,
ca
n't
hide
their
frustration
with
the
Republican
's
ambivalence
.
###
``
He
does
n't
want
to
lead
the
people
,
''
says
Richard
Traynor
,
president
of
New
Jersey
Right
to
Life
.
###
Moreover
,
by
stepping
outside
the
state
's
pro-choice
tradition
,
Mr.
Courter
aggravates
fears
that
he
is
too
conservative
as
well
on
more
pressing
concerns
such
as
auto
insurance
rates
and
the
environment
.
###
He
hurt
himself
further
this
summer
by
bringing
homosexual
issues
into
the
debate
;
and
by
wavering
on
this
issue
and
abortion
,
he
has
weakened
his
credibility
in
what
is
already
a
mean-spirited
campaign
on
both
sides
.
###
Elected
to
Congress
in
1978
,
the
48-year-old
Mr.
Courter
is
part
of
a
generation
of
young
conservatives
who
were
once
very
much
in
the
lead
of
the
rightward
shift
under
Mr.
Reagan
.
###
Like
many
of
his
colleagues
,
he
did
n't
serve
in
Vietnam
in
the
1960s
yet
embraced
a
hawkish
defense
and
foreign
policy
--
even
voting
against
a
1984
resolution
critical
of
the
U.S.
mining
of
Nicaraguan
harbors
.
###
Jack
Kemp
and
the
writers
Irving
Kristol
and
George
Gilder
were
influences
,
and
Mr.
Courter
's
own
conservative
credentials
proved
useful
to
the
current
New
Jersey
GOP
governor
,
Thomas
Kean
,
in
the
1981
Republican
primary
here
.
###
The
same
partnership
is
now
crucial
to
Mr.
Courter
's
fortunes
,
but
the
abortion
issue
is
only
a
reminder
of
the
gap
between
his
record
and
that
of
the
more
moderate
,
pro-choice
Gov.
Kean
.
###
While
the
Warren
County
congressman
pursued
an
anti-government
,
anti-tax
agenda
in
Washington
,
Gov.
Kean
was
approving
increased
income
and
sales
taxes
at
home
and
overseeing
a
near
doubling
in
the
size
of
New
Jersey
's
budget
in
his
eight
years
in
office
.
###
Kean
forces
play
down
any
differences
with
Mr.
Courter
,
but
this
history
makes
it
harder
for
the
conservative
to
run
against
government
.
###
Mr.
Courter
's
free-market
plan
to
bring
down
auto
insurance
rates
met
criticism
from
Gov.
Kean
's
own
insurance
commissioner
.
###
Mr.
Courter
is
further
hobbled
by
a
record
of
votes
opposed
to
government
regulation
on
behalf
of
consumers
.
###
Fluent
in
Spanish
from
his
days
in
the
Peace
Corps
,
Mr.
Courter
actively
courts
minority
voters
but
seems
oddly
over
his
head
.
###
He
is
warm
and
polished
before
a
Puerto
Rican
Congress
in
Asbury
Park
.
###
Yet
minutes
after
promising
to
appoint
Hispanics
to
high
posts
in
state
government
,
he
is
unable
to
say
whether
he
has
ever
employed
any
in
his
congressional
office
.
###
``
I
do
n't
think
we
do
now
,
''
he
says
.
###
``
I
think
we
did
.
''
###
Asked
the
same
question
after
his
appearance
,
Democrat
Florio
identifies
a
staff
member
by
name
and
explains
her
whereabouts
today
.
###
When
he
is
presented
with
a
poster
celebrating
the
organization
's
20th
anniversary
,
he
recognizes
a
photograph
of
one
of
the
founders
and
recalls
time
spent
together
in
Camden
.
###
Details
and
Camden
are
essential
Florio
.
###
Elected
to
Congress
as
a
``
Watergate
baby
''
in
1974
,
he
ran
for
governor
three
years
later
.
###
In
the
opinion
of
many
,
he
has
n't
stopped
running
since
,
even
though
he
declined
a
rematch
with
Gov.
Kean
in
1985
.
###
His
base
in
South
Jersey
and
on
the
House
Energy
and
Commerce
Committee
helped
him
sustain
a
network
of
political-action
committees
to
preserve
his
edge
.
###
With
limited
budgets
for
television
in
a
high-priced
market
,
Mr.
Florio
's
higher
recognition
than
his
rival
is
a
major
advantage
.
###
More
than
ever
,
his
pro-consumer
and
pro-environment
record
is
in
sync
with
the
state
.
###
Auto
insurance
rates
are
soaring
.
###
A
toxic-waste-dump
fire
destroyed
part
of
an
interstate
highway
this
summer
.
###
In
Monmouth
,
an
important
swing
area
,
Republican
freeholders
now
run
on
a
slogan
promising
to
keep
the
county
``
clean
and
green
.
''
###
Mr.
Florio
savors
this
vindication
,
but
at
age
52
,
the
congressman
is
also
a
product
of
his
times
and
losses
.
###
He
speaks
for
the
death
penalty
as
if
reading
from
Exodus
21
;
to
increase
state
revenue
he
focuses
not
on
``
taxes
''
but
on
``
audits
''
to
cut
waste
.
###
Hard-hitting
consultants
match
ads
with
Mr.
Courter
's
team
,
and
Mr.
Florio
retools
himself
as
the
lean
,
mean
Democratic
fighting
machine
of
the
1990s
.
###
Appealing
to
a
young
audience
,
he
scraps
an
old
reference
to
Ozzie
and
Harriet
and
instead
quotes
the
Grateful
Dead
.
###
The
lyric
chosen
--
``
long
strange
night
''
--
may
be
an
apt
footnote
to
television
spots
by
both
candidates
intended
to
portray
each
other
as
a
liar
.
###
The
Democratic
lawmaker
fits
a
pattern
of
younger
reformers
arising
out
of
old
machines
,
but
his
ties
to
Camden
remain
a
sore
point
because
of
the
county
's
past
corruption
.
###
His
campaign
hierarchy
is
chosen
from
elsewhere
in
the
state
,
and
faced
with
criticism
of
a
sweetheart
bank
investment
,
he
has
so
far
blunted
the
issue
by
donating
the
bulk
of
his
profits
to
his
alma
mater
,
Trenton
State
College
.
###
Mr.
Florio
's
forcefulness
on
the
abortion
issue
after
the
Webster
ruling
divides
some
of
his
old
constituency
.

the
stock
market
plunged
more
than
190
points
last
Friday
.
###
The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
rallied
on
the
news
,
closing
39.55
points
higher
at
2683.20
.
###
Bond
prices
also
jumped
as
traders
appeared
to
read
the
data
as
a
sign
that
interest
rates
may
fall
.
###
But
many
economists
were
not
nearly
as
jubilant
.
###
The
climb
in
wholesale
energy
prices
is
certain
to
push
up
retail
energy
prices
in
the
next
few
months
,
they
warned
.
###
They
also
said
the
dollar
is
leveling
off
after
a
rise
this
summer
that
helped
to
reduce
the
prices
of
imported
goods
.
###
``
I
think
inflation
is
going
to
pick
up
through
the
fall
,
''
said
Joel
Popkin
,
a
specialist
on
inflation
who
runs
an
economic
consulting
firm
here
.
###
``
It
has
been
in
what
I
would
describe
as
a
lull
for
the
past
several
months
.
''
###
``
We
've
had
whopping
declines
in
consumer
energy
prices
in
each
of
the
past
three
months
,
and
at
the
wholesale
level
those
are
fully
behind
us
now
,
''
said
Jay
Woodworth
,
chief
domestic
economist
at
Bankers
Trust
Co.
in
New
York
.
###
Because
wholesale
energy
prices
shot
up
by
a
steep
6.5
%
last
month
,
many
analysts
expected
energy
prices
to
rise
at
the
consumer
level
too
.
###
As
a
result
,
many
economists
were
expecting
the
consumer
price
index
to
increase
significantly
more
than
it
did
.
###
But
retail
energy
prices
declined
0.9
%
in
September
.
###
Though
analysts
say
competition
will
probably
hold
down
increases
in
retail
energy
prices
,
many
expect
some
of
the
wholesale
rise
to
be
passed
along
to
the
consumer
before
the
end
of
the
year
.
###
Still
,
some
analysts
insisted
that
the
worst
of
the
inflation
is
behind
.
###
``
It
increasingly
appears
that
1987-88
was
a
temporary
inflation
blip
and
not
the
beginning
of
a
cyclical
inflation
problem
,
''
argued
Edward
Yardeni
,
chief
economist
at
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc.
in
New
York
.
###
In
both
1987
and
1988
,
consumer
prices
rose
4.4
%
.
###
A
run-up
in
world
oil
prices
last
winter
sent
consumer
prices
soaring
at
a
6.7
%
annual
rate
in
the
first
five
months
of
this
year
,
but
the
subsequent
decline
in
energy
prices
has
pulled
the
annual
rate
back
down
to
4.4
%
.
###
Mr.
Yardeni
predicted
that
world
business
competition
will
continue
to
restrain
prices
.
###
``
The
bottom
line
is
,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
economic
environment
has
become
very
,
very
competitve
for
a
lot
of
businesses
,
''
he
said
.
###
``
Back
in
1987-88
,
business
was
operating
at
fairly
tight
capacity
,
so
businesses
felt
they
could
raise
prices
.
''
###
Now
,
he
said
,
a
slowdown
in
economic
activity
has
slackened
demand
.
###
The
mild
inflation
figures
renewed
investors
'
hopes
that
the
Federal
Reserve
will
ease
its
interest-rate
stance
.
###
The
steep
climb
in
producer
prices
reported
last
Friday
fostered
pessimism
about
lower
interest
rates
and
contributed
to
the
stock
market
's
6.9
%
plunge
that
day
.
###
In
the
past
several
days
,
however
,
the
U.S.
's
central
bank
has
allowed
a
key
interest
rate
to
fall
slightly
to
try
to
stabilize
the
markets
.
###
Analysts
say
Fed
policy
makers
have
been
wary
of
relaxing
credit
too
much
because
they
were
still
uncertain
about
the
level
of
inflation
in
the
economy
.
###
Excluding
the
volatile
categories
of
energy
and
food
--
leaving
what
some
economists
call
the
core
inflation
rate
--
consumer
prices
still
rose
only
0.2
%
in
September
.
###
Transportation
costs
actually
fell
0.5
%
,
and
housing
costs
gained
only
0.1
%
.
###
Apparel
prices
rocketed
up
1.7
%
,
but
that
was
after
three
months
of
declines
.
###
Medical
costs
continued
their
steep
ascent
,
rising
0.8
%
after
four
consecutive
months
of
0.7
%
increases
.
###
Car
prices
,
another
area
that
contributed
to
the
steep
rise
in
the
wholesale
index
last
month
,
still
showed
declines
at
the
consumer
level
.
###
They
dropped
0.4
%
as
dealers
continued
to
offer
rebates
to
attract
customers
.
###
Food
prices
rose
0.2
%
for
the
second
month
in
a
row
,
far
slower
than
the
monthly
rises
earlier
in
the
year
.
###
Separately
,
the
Labor
Department
reported
that
average
weekly
earnings
rose
0.3
%
in
September
,
after
adjusting
for
inflation
,
following
a
0.7
%
decline
in
August
.
###
All
the
numbers
are
adjusted
for
seasonal
fluctuations
.
###
Here
are
the
seasonally
adjusted
changes
in
the
components
of
the
Labor
Department
's
consumer
price
index
for
September
.
###
After
watching
interest
in
the
sport
plummet
for
years
,
the
ski
industry
is
trying
to
give
itself
a
lift
.
###
Across
the
country
,
resorts
are
using
everything
from
fireworks
to
classical-music
concerts
to
attract
new
customers
.
###
Some
have
built
health
spas
,
business
centers
and
shopping
villages
so
visitors
have
more
to
do
than
ski
.
###
And
this
week
,
the
industry
's
efforts
will
go
national
for
the
first
time
when
it
unveils
a
$
7
million
advertising
campaign
.
###
Such
efforts
--
unheard
of
only
a
few
years
ago
--
are
the
latest
attempts
to
revive
the
sagging
$
1.76
billion
U.S.
ski
industry
.
###
Since
the
start
of
the
decade
,
lift-ticket
sales
have
grown
only
3
%
a
year
on
average
,
compared
with
16
%
annual
growth
rates
in
the
'60s
and
'70s
.
###
Last
season
,
lift-ticket
sales
fell
for
the
first
time
in
seven
years
.
###
By
some
estimates
,
nearly
a
fourth
of
all
U.S.
ski
areas
have
been
forced
to
shut
down
since
the
early
'80s
.
###
Competition
and
mounting
insurance
and
equipment
costs
have
been
the
undoing
of
many
resorts
.
###
But
another
big
problem
has
been
the
aging
of
baby
boomers
.
###
Skiing
,
after
all
,
has
mainly
been
for
the
young
and
daring
and
many
baby
boomers
have
outgrown
skiing
or
have
too
many
family
responsibilities
to
stick
with
the
sport
.
###
In
its
new
ad
campaign
,
created
by
D'Arcy
Masius
Benton
&
Bowles
Inc.
,
Chicago
,
the
ski
industry
is
trying
to
change
its
image
as
a
sport
primarily
for
young
white
people
.
###
One
60-second
TV
spot
features
a
diverse
group
of
skiers
gracefully
gliding
down
sun-drenched
slopes
:
senior
citizens
,
minorities
,
families
with
children
--
even
a
blind
skier
.
###
``
Ski
school
is
great
,
''
cries
out
a
tot
,
bundled
in
a
snowsuit
as
he
plows
down
a
bunny
slope
.
###
``
You
'll
never
know'til
you
try
,
''
says
a
black
skier
.
###
``
We
used
to
show
some
hot-dog
skier
in
his
twenties
or
thirties
going
over
the
edge
of
a
cliff
,
''
says
Kathe
Dillmann
,
a
spokeswoman
for
the
United
Ski
Industries
Association
,
the
trade
group
sponsoring
the
campaign
.
###
Ski
promotions
have
traditionally
avoided
the
touchy
issue
of
safety
.
###
But
the
new
commercials
deal
with
it
indirectly
by
showing
a
woman
smiling
as
she
tries
to
get
up
from
a
fall
.
###
``
We
wanted
to
show
it
's
okay
if
you
fall
,
''
says
Ms.
Dillmann
.
###
``
Most
people
think
if
you
slip
,
you
'll
wind
up
in
a
body
cast
.
''
###
The
ad
campaign
represents
an
unusual
spirit
of
cooperation
among
resorts
and
ski
equipment
makers
;
normally
,
they
only
run
ads
hyping
their
own
products
and
facilities
.
###
But
in
these
crunch
times
for
the
ski
industry
,
some
resorts
,
such
as
the
Angel
Fire
,
Red
River
and
Taos
ski
areas
in
New
Mexico
,
have
even
started
shuttle-busing
skiers
to
each
other
's
slopes
and
next
year
plan
to
sell
tickets
good
for
all
local
lifts
.
###
Many
resorts
also
are
focusing
more
on
the
service
side
of
their
business
.
###
Since
40
%
of
skiers
are
parents
,
many
slopes
are
building
nurseries
,
expanding
ski
schools
and
adding
entertainment
for
kids
.
###
Vail
,
Colo.
,
now
has
a
playland
that
looks
like
an
old
mining
town
;
kids
can
ski
through
and
pan
for
fool
's
gold
.
###
For
$
15
,
they
can
enjoy
their
own
nightly
entertainment
,
with
dinner
,
without
mom
and
dad
.
###
A
few
years
ago
,
parents
usually
had
to
hire
a
sitter
or
take
turns
skiing
while
one
spouse
stayed
with
the
children
.
###
``
Most
parents
who
had
to
go
through
that
never
came
back
,
''
says
Michael
Shannon
,
president
of
Vail
Associates
Inc.
,
which
owns
and
operates
the
Vail
and
nearby
Beaver
Creek
resorts
.
###
To
make
skiing
more
convenient
for
time-strapped
visitors
,
several
resorts
are
buying
or
starting
their
own
travel
agencies
.
###
In
one
phone
call
,
ski
buffs
can
make
hotel
and
restaurant
reservations
,
buy
lift
tickets
,
rent
ski
equipment
and
sign
up
for
lessons
.
###
And
resorts
are
adding
other
amenities
,
such
as
pricey
restaurants
,
health
spas
and
vacation
packages
with
a
twist
.
###
During
Winter
Carnival
week
,
for
example
,
visitors
at
Sunday
River
in
Maine
can
take
a
hot-air
balloon
ride
.
###
``
People
these
days
want
something
else
to
do
besides
ski
and
sit
in
the
bar
,
''
says
Don
Borgeson
,
executive
director
of
Angel
Fire
,
N.M.
's
Chamber
of
Commerce
.
###
The
ski
industry
hopes
to
increase
the
number
of
skiers
by
3.5
million
to
about
21.7
million
in
the
next
five
years
with
its
latest
ads
and
promotions
.
###
But
some
think
that
's
being
overly
optimistic
.
###
For
one
thing
,
it
may
be
tough
to
attract
people
because
skiing
is
still
expensive
:
a
lift
ticket
can
cost
up
to
$
35
a
day
and
equipment
prices
are
rising
.
###
And
most
vacationers
still
prefer
a
warm
climate
for
their
winter
excursions
.
###
An
American
Express
Co.
survey
of
its
travel
agents
revealed
that
only
34
%
believe
their
clients
will
pick
a
trip
this
winter
based
on
the
availability
of
winter
sports
,
as
opposed
to
69
%
who
think
that
warm-weather
sports
will
be
the
deciding
factor
.
###
``
Even
if
they
could
bring
in
that
many
new
skiers
,
I
do
n't
know
if
-LCB-
the
industry
-RCB-
could
handle
that
kind
of
an
increase
,
''
says
I.
William
Berry
,
editor
and
publisher
of
the
Ski
Industry
Letter
in
Katonah
,
N.Y
.
###
``
Most
people
will
come
on
the
weekend
,
the
slopes
will
be
overcrowded
and
then
these
-LCB-
new
skiers
-RCB-
wo
n't
come
back
.
###
They
did
n't
play
the
third
game
of
the
World
Series
on
Tuesday
night
as
scheduled
,
and
they
did
n't
play
it
on
Wednesday
or
Thursday
either
.
###
But
you
knew
that
,
did
n't
you
?
###
They
are
supposed
to
play
the
game
next
Tuesday
,
in
Candlestick
Park
here
.
###
The
theory
is
that
the
stadium
,
damaged
by
Tuesday
's
earthquake
,
will
be
repaired
by
then
,
and
that
people
will
be
able
to
get
there
.
###
Like
just
about
everything
else
,
that
remains
to
be
seen
.
###
Aftershocks
could
intervene
.
###
But
,
at
least
,
the
law
of
averages
should
have
swung
to
the
favorable
side
.
###
It
may
seem
trivial
to
worry
about
the
World
Series
amid
the
destruction
to
the
Bay
Area
wrought
by
Tuesday
's
quake
,
but
the
name
of
this
column
is
``
On
Sports
,
''
so
I
feel
obliged
to
do
so
.
###
You
might
be
interested
to
know
that
baseball
,
not
survival
,
appeared
to
be
the
first
thought
of
most
of
the
crowd
of
60,000-odd
that
had
gathered
at
Candlestick
at
5:04
p.m.
Tuesday
,
a
half-hour
before
game
time
,
when
the
quake
struck
.
###
As
soon
as
the
tremor
passed
,
many
people
spontaneously
arose
and
cheered
,
as
though
it
had
been
a
novel
kind
of
pre-game
show
.
###
One
fan
,
seated
several
rows
in
front
of
the
open
,
upper-deck
auxiliary
press
section
where
I
was
stationed
,
faced
the
assembled
newsies
and
laughingly
shouted
,
``
We
arranged
that
just
for
you
guys
''
I
thought
and
,
I
'm
sure
,
others
did
:
``
You
should
n't
have
bothered
.
''
###
I
'd
slept
through
my
only
previous
brush
with
natural
disaster
,
a
tornado
15
or
so
summers
ago
near
Traverse
City
,
Mich.
,
so
I
was
unprepared
for
one
reaction
to
such
things
:
the
urge
to
talk
about
them
.
###
Perhaps
primed
by
the
daily
diet
of
radio
and
TV
reporters
thrusting
microphones
into
people
's
faces
and
asking
how
they
``
feel
''
about
one
calamity
or
another
,
fellow
reporters
and
civilians
who
spied
my
press
credential
were
eager
to
chat
.
###
``
It
felt
like
I
was
on
a
station
platform
and
a
train
went
by
,
''
said
one
man
,
describing
my
own
reaction
.
###
A
women
said
she
saw
the
park
's
light
standards
sway
.
###
A
man
said
he
saw
the
upper
rim
undulate
.
###
I
saw
neither
.
###
Dictates
of
good
sense
to
the
contrary
not
withstanding
,
the
general
inclination
was
to
believe
that
the
disturbance
would
be
brief
and
that
ball
would
be
played
.
###
``
I
was
near
the
top
of
the
stadium
,
and
saw
a
steel
girder
bow
six
feet
from
where
I
sat
,
but
I
stayed
put
for
10
or
15
minutes
,
''
confessed
a
friend
.
###
``
I
guess
I
thought
,
`
This
is
the
World
Series
and
I
'm
not
gon
na
wimp
out
'
''
###
Here
in
the
Global
Village
,
though
,
folks
do
not
stay
uninformed
for
long
.
###
Electrical
power
was
out
in
still-daylighted
Candlestick
Park
,
but
battery-operated
radios
and
television
sets
were
plentiful
.
###
Within
a
few
minutes
,
the
true
extent
of
the
catastrophe
was
becoming
clear
.
###
Its
Richter
Scale
measurement
was
reported
as
6.5
,
then
6.9
,
then
7.0
.
###
A
section
of
the
Bay
Bridge
had
collapsed
,
as
had
a
part
of
Interstate
Highway
880
in
Oakland
.
###
People
had
died
.
###
At
5:40
p.m.
,
scheduled
game
time
having
passed
,
some
fans
chanted
``
Let
's
Play
Ball
.
''
###
No
longer
innocent
,
they
qualified
as
fools
.
###
The
stadium
was
ordered
evacuated
soon
afterward
;
the
announcement
,
made
over
police
bullhorns
,
cited
the
power
outage
,
but
it
later
was
revealed
that
there
also
had
been
damage
of
the
sort
reported
by
my
friend
.
###
Outside
,
I
spotted
two
young
men
lugging
blocks
of
concrete
.
###
``
Pieces
of
Candlestick
,
''
they
said
.
###
The
crowd
remained
good
natured
,
even
bemused
.
###
TV
reporters
interviewed
fans
in
the
parking
lots
while
,
a
few
feet
away
,
others
watched
the
interviews
on
their
portable
TVs
.
###
The
only
frenzy
I
saw
was
commercial
:
Booths
selling
World
Series
commemorative
stamps
and
dated
postmarks
were
besieged
by
fledgling
speculators
who
saw
future
profit
in
the
items
.
###
The
traffic
jam
out
of
the
park
was
monumental
.
###
It
took
me
a
half-hour
to
move
10
feet
from
my
parking
spot
in
an
outer
lot
to
an
aisle
,
and
an
additional
hour
to
reach
an
inner
roadway
a
half-block
away
.
###
The
six-mile
trip
to
my
airport
hotel
that
had
taken
20
minutes
earlier
in
the
day
took
more
than
three
hours
.
###
At
my
hotel
,
the
Westin
,
power
was
out
,
some
interior
plaster
had
broken
loose
and
there
had
been
water
damage
,
but
little
else
.
###
With
Garpian
randomness
,
a
hotel
across
the
street
,
the
Amfac
,
had
been
hit
harder
:
A
large
sheet
of
its
concrete
facade
and
several
window
balconies
were
torn
away
.
###
The
Westin
staff
had
,
kindly
,
set
out
lighted
candles
in
the
ballroom
,
prepared
a
cold-cuts
buffet
and
passed
around
pillows
and
blankets
.
###
I
fell
asleep
on
the
lobby
floor
,
next
to
a
man
wearing
a
Chicago
Cubs
jacket
.
###
I
expected
him
to
say
,
``
I
told
you
so
,
''
but
he
already
was
snoring
.
###
The
journalistic
consensus
was
that
the
earthquake
made
the
World
Series
seem
unimportant
.
###
My
response
was
that
sports
rarely
are
important
,
only
diverting
,
and
the
quake
merely
highlighted
that
fact
.
###
Should
the
rest
of
the
Series
be
played
at
all
?
###
The
quake
and
baseball
were
n't
related
,
unlike
the
massacre
of
athletes
that
attended
the
1972
Olympics
.
###
That
heavily
politicized
event
learned
nothing
from
the
horrifying
experience
,
and
seems
doomed
to
repeat
it
.
###
Two
ironies
intrude
.
###
This
has
been
widely
dubbed
the
BART
Series
,
after
the
local
subway
line
,
and
the
Bay
Bridge
Series
.
###
Flags
fly
at
half-staff
for
the
death
of
Bart
Giamatti
,
the
late
baseball
commissioner
,
and
now
the
Bay
Bridge
lies
in
ruins
.
###
A
Series
that
was
shaping
up
as
the
dullest
since
the
one-sided
Detroit-over-San
Diego
go
of
1984
has
become
memorable
in
the
least
fortunate
way
.
###
Still
,
its
edge
is
lost
.
###
It
now
will
be
played
mostly
for
the
record
,
and
should
be
wrapped
up
as
quickly
as
possible
,
without
``
off
''
days
.
###
And
I
will
never
again
complain
about
a
rainout
.
###
The
disarray
in
the
junk-bond
market
that
began
last
month
with
a
credit
crunch
at
Campeau
Corp.
has
offered
commercial
banks
a
golden
opportunity
to
play
a
greater
role
in
financing
billion-dollar
takeovers
.
###
But
two
big
New
York
banks
seem
to
have
kicked
those
chances
away
,
for
the
moment
,
with
the
embarrassing
failure
of
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
to
deliver
$
7.2
billion
in
bank
financing
for
a
leveraged
buy-out
of
United
Airlines
parent
UAL
Corp
.
###
For
more
than
a
decade
,
banks
have
been
pressing
Congress
and
banking
regulators
for
expanded
powers
to
act
like
securities
firms
in
playing
Wall
Street
's
lucrative
takeover
game
,
from
giving
mergers
advice
all
the
way
to
selling
and
trading
high-yield
junk
bonds
.
###
Those
expanded
powers
reached
their
zenith
in
July
when
Bankers
Trust
New
York
Corp.
provided
mergers
advice
,
an
equity
investment
and
bank
loans
for
the
$
3.65
billion
leveraged
buy-out
of
Northwest
Airlines
parent
NWA
Inc
.
###
One
of
the
major
selling
points
used
by
Los
Angeles
financier
Alfred
Checchi
in
getting
the
takeover
approved
was
that
the
deal
did
n't
include
any
junk
bonds
.
###
That
was
seen
as
an
advantage
in
lobbying
airline
employees
and
Washington
regulators
for
approval
of
the
contested
takeover
.
###
All
$
3.35
billion
in
debt
for
the
deal
was
supplied
by
banks
.
###
Charles
Nathan
,
co-head
of
mergers
and
acquisitions
at
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
,
says
it
is
natural
for
banks
to
try
to
expand
beyond
their
bread-and-butter
business
of
providing
senior
debt
for
buy-outs
.
###
But
the
UAL
collapse
,
he
says
,
``
may
tell
you
it
's
not
going
to
work
that
easily
.
''
###
David
Batchelder
,
a
mergers
adviser
in
La
Jolla
,
Calif.
,
who
aided
Los
Angeles
investor
Marvin
Davis
on
the
bids
which
put
both
UAL
and
NWA
in
play
as
takeover
candidates
this
year
,
says
that
banks
have
been
``
preparing
to
play
a
larger
and
larger
role
in
acquisition
financing
.
''
###
Mr.
Batchelder
says
that
in
the
past
,
banks
would
normally
have
loaned
65
%
of
a
total
buy-out
price
,
with
the
loans
secured
by
the
target
company
's
assets
.
###
Another
20
%
of
the
borrowed
funds
would
come
from
the
sale
to
investors
of
junk
bonds
,
which
offer
less
security
and
typically
carry
higher
yields
than
bank
loans
.
###
Mr.
Checchi
's
purchase
of
NWA
,
Mr.
Batchelder
notes
,
``
was
probably
the
most
aggressive
to
date
,
''
with
bank
debt
at
85
%
of
the
purchase
price
.
###
But
Mr.
Batchelder
says
that
Citicorp
's
``
failure
to
deliver
''
on
its
promise
to
raise
the
UAL
bank
debt
for
a
labor-management
buy-out
group
``
is
very
distressing
to
potential
users
of
a
`
highly-confident
'
letter
from
commercial
banks
.
''
###
His
client
,
Mr.
Davis
,
used
just
such
a
letter
from
Citicorp
in
pursuing
UAL
;
Citicorp
later
agreed
to
work
with
a
competing
UAL
buy-out
group
.
###
Executives
of
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
declined
to
comment
on
either
the
UAL
situation
,
or
on
the
changing
nature
of
banks
'
role
in
financing
takeovers
.
###
In
the
wake
of
Campeau
's
problems
,
prices
of
junk
bonds
tumbled
,
throwing
into
doubt
the
ability
of
corporate
acquirers
to
finance
large
takeovers
with
the
help
of
junk
bond
sales
.
###
Mark
Solow
,
senior
managing
director
at
Manufacturers
Hanover
Trust
Co.
,
says
the
falloff
in
junk
bonds
may
yet
open
new
business
opportunities
to
banks
in
structuring
takeovers
.
###
But
he
warns
that
banks
will
have
``
to
have
enough
discipline
''
not
to
make
loans
that
are
too
risky
.
###
In
fact
,
Manufacturers
Hanover
said
in
its
third-quarter
earnings
report
that
fees
from
syndicating
loans
to
other
banks
dropped
48
%
,
to
$
21
million
.
###
``
We
did
n't
take
part
in
a
lot
of
deals
because
their
credit
quality
was
poor
,
''
says
a
bank
spokesman
.
###
James
B.
Lee
,
head
of
syndications
and
private
placements
at
Chemical
Banking
Corp.
,
said
he
believes
banks
can
still
make
a
credible
offer
of
one-stop
shopping
for
takeover
finance
.
###
As
evidence
,
he
cites
yesterday
's
arrangement
for
the
final
financing
of
a
$
3
billion
bid
for
American
Medical
International
Inc.
in
which
Chemical
served
as
both
the
lead
bank
and
an
equity
investor
.
###
Beyond
the
current
weakness
in
the
junk
bond
market
,
banks
have
another
advantage
over
investment
banks
in
financing
contested
takeovers
.
###
Arthur
Fleischer
Jr.
,
a
takeover
lawyer
at
Fried
Frank
Harris
Shriver
&
Jacobson
,
notes
that
``
a
political
and
emotional
bias
''
has
developed
against
junk
bonds
.
###
One
hostile
bidder
who
deliberately
avoided
using
junk
bonds
was
Paramount
Communications
Inc.
in
its
initial
offer
to
acquire
Time
Inc.
for
$
10.7
billion
,
or
$
175
a
share
.
###
A
Paramount
spokesman
says
that
decision
was
based
on
the
financial
,
not
political
,
drawbacks
of
junk
bonds
.
###
But
some
observers
believe
Paramount
Chairman
Martin
Davis
wanted
to
avoid
the
possible
taint
of
being
perceived
as
a
corporate
raider
in
his
controversial
bid
for
Time
.
###
In
the
end
,
Mr.
Davis
used
junk
bonds
so
that
he
could
raise
Paramount
's
bid
to
$
200
a
share
.
###
Some
Monday-morning
quarterbacks
said
the
initial
lower
bid
,
without
junk
bonds
,
was
a
factor
in
his
losing
the
company
.
###
Time
eluded
Paramount
by
acquiring
Warner
Communications
Inc
.
###
The
success
of
the
NWA
financing
,
and
the
failure
of
the
UAL
deal
,
also
seem
to
highlight
the
important
new
role
in
takeover
financing
being
played
by
Japanese
banks
.
###
Japanese
banks
accounted
for
50
%
of
the
NWA
bank
debt
,
according
to
a
report
by
Transportation
Secretary
Samuel
Skinner
.
###
But
it
was
broad-scale
rejection
by
Japanese
banks
that
helped
seal
the
fate
of
the
attempt
to
buy
UAL
.
###
Citicorp
and
Chase
are
attempting
to
put
together
a
new
,
lower
bid
.
###
Takanori
Mizuno
,
chief
economist
of
the
Institute
for
Financial
Affairs
Inc.
,
a
Tokyo
research
center
on
finance
and
economics
,
says
,
``
The
junk
bond
market
became
very
jittery
,
and
there
's
a
fear
of
a
coming
recession
and
the
possible
bankruptcy
of
LBO
companies
.
###
Harley-Davidson
Inc.
filed
suit
in
federal
court
here
,
alleging
that
a
group
that
holds
6.2
%
of
its
stock
made
``
false
,
deceptive
and
misleading
''
statements
in
recent
regulatory
filings
and
public
announcements
.
###
Harley-Davidson
's
complaint
claims
that
the
group
,
led
by
investor
Malcolm
I.
Glazer
,
violated
securities
laws
by
failing
to
disclose
plans
to
purchase
15
%
of
the
company
's
shares
outstanding
and
that
when
the
required
Hart-Scott-Rodino
filing
eventually
was
made
,
it
did
n't
disclose
the
group
's
alleged
earlier
violation
of
the
so-called
prior-notice
requirements
of
the
law
.
###
Mr.
Glazer
could
n't
immediately
be
reached
to
comment
.
###
But
when
Harley
last
week
publicly
questioned
the
legality
of
the
group
's
filing
procedures
,
the
Rochester
,
N.Y.
,
investor
said
``
we
complied
with
every
law
,
''
and
he
denied
any
wrongdoing
.
###
The
Glazer
group
said
in
a
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filing
in
early
October
that
it
may
seek
a
controlling
interest
in
Harley-Davidson
,
or
seek
representation
on
the
company
's
board
.
###
Harley
has
said
it
does
n't
intend
to
be
acquired
by
the
Glazer
group
or
any
other
party
.
###
Inland
Steel
Industries
Inc.
,
battered
by
lower
volume
and
higher
costs
,
posted
a
75
%
drop
in
third-quarter
earnings
.
###
The
nation
's
fourth-largest
steelmaker
earned
$
18.3
million
,
or
43
cents
a
share
,
compared
with
$
61
million
,
or
$
1.70
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
,
when
the
industry
was
enjoying
peak
demand
and
strong
pricing
.
###
Sales
fell
to
$
981.2
million
from
$
1.02
billion
.
###
The
earnings
also
mark
a
significant
drop
from
the
second
quarter
's
$
45.3
million
or
$
1.25
a
share
.
###
Moreover
,
the
earnings
were
well
below
analysts
'
expectations
of
about
$
1.16
a
share
.
###
In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
Inland
closed
yesterday
at
$
35.875
a
share
,
down
$
1
.
###
The
company
attributed
the
earnings
drop
to
lower
volume
related
to
seasonal
demand
and
the
soft
consumer
durable
market
,
especially
in
the
automotive
sector
.
###
However
,
the
company
also
lost
orders
because
of
prolonged
labor
talks
in
the
second
quarter
.
###
Third-quarter
shipments
slipped
7
%
from
the
year-ago
period
,
and
17
%
from
this
year
's
second
quarter
.
###
Profit
of
steel
shipped
for
the
company
's
steel
segment
slid
to
$
26
a
ton
,
from
$
66
a
ton
a
year
earlier
and
$
57
a
ton
a
quarter
earlier
.
###
Analysts
noted
that
the
disappointing
results
do
n't
reflect
lower
prices
for
steel
products
.
###
Charles
Bradford
,
an
analyst
with
Merrill
Lynch
Capital
Markets
,
said
higher
prices
for
galvanized
and
cold-rolled
products
offset
lower
prices
for
bar
,
hot-rolled
and
structural
steel
.
###
Structural
steel
,
which
primarily
serves
the
construction
market
,
was
especially
hurt
by
a
15
%
price
drop
,
Mr.
Bradford
said
.
###
The
company
said
its
integrated
steel
sector
was
also
hurt
by
higher
raw
material
,
repair
and
maintenance
,
and
labor
costs
.
###
The
increased
labor
costs
became
effective
Aug.
1
under
terms
of
the
four-year
labor
agreement
with
the
United
Steelworkers
union
.
###
Meanwhile
,
the
company
's
service
center
segment
,
which
saw
operating
profit
drop
to
$
11.5
million
from
$
30.7
million
a
year
ago
,
experienced
much
of
the
same
demand
and
cost
problems
,
as
well
as
start-up
costs
associated
with
a
coil
processing
facility
in
Chicago
and
an
upgraded
computer
information
system
.
###
Inland
Chairman
Frank
W.
Luerssen
said
the
company
's
short-term
outlook
is
``
clouded
by
uncertainties
in
the
economy
and
financial
markets
.
''
###
However
,
he
noted
that
steel
mill
bookings
are
up
from
early
summer
levels
,
and
that
he
expects
the
company
to
improve
its
cost
performance
in
the
fourth
quarter
.
###
In
the
first
nine
months
,
profit
was
$
113
million
,
or
$
3.04
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
3.19
billion
,
compared
with
$
204.5
million
,
or
$
5.76
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
3.03
billion
,
a
year
earlier
.
###
The
``
seismic
''
activity
of
a
financial
market
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
seismic
activity
of
the
earth
.
###
When
things
are
quiet
-LRB-
low
volatility
-RRB-
,
the
structures
on
which
markets
stand
can
be
relatively
inefficient
and
still
perform
their
functions
adequately
.
###
However
,
when
powerful
forces
start
shaking
the
market
's
structure
,
the
more
``
earthquake-resistant
''
it
is
,
the
better
its
chance
for
survival
.
###
America
's
financial
markets
do
not
yet
have
all
the
required
modern
features
required
to
make
them
fully
``
aftershock-resistant
.
''
###
Investors
lack
equal
access
to
the
markets
'
trading
arena
and
its
information
.
###
That
structural
lack
is
crucial
because
investors
are
the
only
source
of
market
liquidity
.
###
And
liquidity
is
what
markets
need
to
damp
quakes
and
aftershocks
.
###
In
today
's
markets
,
specialists
-LRB-
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
-RRB-
and
``
upstairs
''
market
makers
-LRB-
in
the
over-the-counter
market
-RRB-
are
the
only
market
participants
allowed
to
play
a
direct
role
in
the
price-determination
process
.
###
When
they
halt
trading
,
all
market
liquidity
is
gone
.
###
And
when
any
component
of
the
market
--
cash
,
futures
or
options
--
loses
liquidity
,
the
price
discovery
system
-LRB-
the
way
prices
are
determined
-RRB-
becomes
flawed
or
is
lost
entirely
for
a
time
.
###
Last
Friday
the
13th
-LRB-
as
well
as
two
years
ago
this
week
-RRB-
the
markets
became
unlinked
.
###
When
that
happened
,
``
seismic
''
tremors
of
fear
--
much
like
the
shock
waves
created
by
an
earthquake
--
coursed
through
the
market
and
increased
the
market
's
volatility
.
###
Lack
of
important
,
needed
information
can
cause
fear
.
###
Fear
is
the
father
of
panic
.
###
Panic
frequently
results
in
irrational
behavior
.
###
And
in
financial
markets
,
irrational
behavior
is
sometimes
translated
into
catastrophe
.
###
When
market
tremors
start
,
it
is
crucial
that
as
much
information
about
transaction
prices
and
the
supply-demand
curve
-LRB-
buy
and
sell
orders
at
various
prices
-RRB-
be
made
available
to
all
,
not
just
to
market
makers
.
###
Because
of
a
lack
of
information
and
access
,
many
investors
--
including
the
very
ones
whose
buying
power
could
restore
stability
and
damp
volatility
--
are
forced
to
stand
on
the
sidelines
when
they
are
most
needed
,
because
of
their
ignorance
of
important
market
information
.
###
To
add
aftershock-damping
power
to
America
's
markets
,
a
modern
,
electronic
trading
system
should
be
implemented
that
permits
equal
access
to
the
trading
arena
-LRB-
and
the
information
that
would
automatically
accompany
such
access
-RRB-
by
investors
--
particularly
institutional
investors
.
###
Contrary
to
some
opinions
,
the
trading
activities
of
specialists
and
other
market
makers
do
not
provide
liquidity
to
the
market
as
a
whole
.
###
What
market
makers
provide
is
immediacy
,
a
very
valuable
service
.
###
Liquidity
is
not
a
service
.
###
It
is
a
market
attribute
--
the
ability
to
absorb
selling
orders
without
causing
significant
price
changes
in
the
absence
of
news
.
###
Market
makers
buy
what
investors
wish
to
sell
;
their
business
is
reselling
these
unwanted
positions
as
quickly
as
possible
to
other
investors
,
and
at
a
profit
.
###
As
a
result
,
while
any
one
customer
may
purchase
immediacy
by
selling
to
a
market
maker
-LRB-
which
is
micro-liquidity
for
the
investor
-RRB-
,
the
market
as
a
whole
remains
in
the
same
circumstances
it
was
before
the
transaction
:
The
unwanted
position
is
still
an
unwanted
position
;
only
the
identity
of
the
seller
has
changed
.
###
In
fact
it
can
be
argued
that
increasing
capital
commitments
by
market
makers
-LRB-
a
result
of
some
post-1987
crash
studies
-RRB-
also
increases
market
volatility
,
since
the
more
securities
are
held
by
market
makers
at
any
given
time
,
the
more
selling
pressure
is
overhanging
the
market
.
###
In
an
open
electronic
system
,
any
investor
wishing
to
pay
for
real-time
access
to
the
trading
arena
through
a
registered
broker-dealer
would
be
able
to
see
the
entire
supply-demand
curve
-LRB-
buy
and
sell
orders
at
each
price
-RRB-
entered
by
dealers
and
investors
alike
,
and
to
enter
and
execute
orders
.
###
Current
quotations
would
reflect
the
combined
financial
judgment
of
all
market
participants
--
not
just
those
of
intermediaries
who
become
extremely
risk-averse
during
times
of
crisis
.
###
Investors
and
professionals
alike
would
compete
on
the
level
playing
field
Congress
sought
and
called
a
``
national
market
system
''
-LRB-
not
yet
achieved
-RRB-
almost
15
years
ago
when
it
passed
the
Securities
Reform
Act
of
1975
.

###
I
'm
not

But
I
am
sure
we
need
to
maximize
our
``

''
protection
by
making
certain

markets

NOW
YOU
SEE
IT
,
now
you
do
n't
.
###
The
recession
,
that
is
.
###
The
economy
's
stutter
steps
leave
investors
wondering
whether
things
are
slowing
down
or
speeding
up
.
###
So
often
are
government
statistics
revised
that
they
seem
to
resemble
a
spinning
weather
vane
.
###
For
the
past
seven
years
,
investors
have
had
the
wind
at
their
backs
,
in
the
form
of
a
generally
growing
economy
.
###
Some
may
have
forgotten
--
and
some
younger
ones
may
never
have
experienced
--
what
it
's
like
to
invest
during
a
recession
.
###
Different
tactics
are
called
for
,
as
losing
money
becomes
easier
and
making
money
becomes
tougher
.
###
For
those
investors
who
believe
--
or
fear
--
that
1990
will
be
a
recession
year
,
many
economists
and
money
managers
agree
on
steps
that
can
be
taken
to
lower
the
risks
in
a
portfolio
.
###
In
a
nutshell
,
pros
advise
investors
who
expect
a
slowdown
to
hold
fewer
stocks
than
usual
and
to
favor
shares
of
big
companies
in
``
defensive
''
industries
.
###
A
heavy
dose
of
cash
is
prescribed
,
along
with
a
heavier-than-usual
allotment
to
bonds
--
preferably
government
bonds
.
###
It
's
tempting
to
think
these
defensive
steps
can
be
delayed
until
a
recession
is
clearly
at
hand
.
###
But
that
may
not
be
possible
,
because
recessions
often
take
investors
by
surprise
.
###
``
They
always
seem
to
come
a
bit
later
than
you
expect
.
###
When
they
do
hit
,
they
hit
fast
,
''
says
David
A.
Wyss
,
chief
financial
economist
at
the
Data
Resources
division
of
McGraw-Hill
Inc
.
###
Though
he
himself
does
n't
expect
a
recession
soon
,
Mr.
Wyss
advises
people
who
do
that
``
the
best
thing
to
be
in
is
long
that
is
,
20-year
to
30-year
Treasury
bonds
.
''
###
The
reason
is
simple
,
Mr.
Wyss
says
:
``
Interest
rates
almost
always
decline
during
recession
.
''
###
As
surely
as
a
seesaw
tilts
,
falling
interest
rates
force
up
the
price
of
previously
issued
bonds
.
###
They
are
worth
more
because
they
pay
higher
interest
than
newly
issued
bonds
do
.
###
That
effect
holds
true
for
both
short-term
and
long-term
bonds
.
###
But
short-term
bonds
ca
n't
rise
too
much
,
because
everyone
knows
they
will
be
redeemed
at
a
preset
price
fairly
soon
.
###
Long-term
bonds
,
with
many
years
left
before
maturity
,
swing
more
widely
in
price
.
###
But
not
just
any
bonds
will
do
.
###
Corporate
bonds
``
are
usually
not
a
good
bet
in
a
recession
,
''
Mr.
Wyss
says
.
###
As
times
get
tougher
,
investors
fret
about
whether
companies
will
have
enough
money
to
pay
their
debts
.
###
This
hurts
the
price
of
corporate
bonds
.
###
Also
,
he
notes
,
``
most
corporate
bonds
are
callable
.
''
###
That
means
that
a
corporation
,
after
a
specified
amount
of
time
has
passed
,
can
buy
back
its
bonds
by
paying
investors
the
face
value
-LRB-
plus
,
in
some
cases
,
a
sweetener
-RRB-
.
###
When
interest
rates
have
dropped
,
it
makes
sense
for
corporations
to
do
just
that
;
they
then
save
on
interest
costs
.
###
But
the
investors
are
left
stranded
with
money
to
reinvest
at
a
time
when
interest
rates
are
puny
.
###
If
corporate
bonds
are
bad
in
recessions
,
junk
bonds
are
likely
to
be
the
worst
of
all
.
###
It
's
an
``
absolute
necessity
''
to
get
out
of
junk
bonds
when
a
recession
is
in
the
offing
,
says
Avner
Arbel
,
professor
of
finance
at
Cornell
University
.
###
``
Such
bonds
are
very
sensitive
to
the
downside
,
and
this
could
be
a
disaster
.
''
###
Municipal
bonds
are
generally
a
bit
safer
than
corporate
bonds
in
a
recession
,
but
not
as
safe
as
bonds
issued
by
the
federal
government
.
###
During
an
economic
slump
,
local
tax
revenues
often
go
down
,
raising
the
risks
associated
with
at
least
some
municipals
.
###
And
,
like
corporates
,
many
municipal
bonds
are
callable
.
###
But
a
few
experts
,
going
against
the
consensus
,
do
n't
think
bonds
would
help
investors
even
if
a
recession
is
in
the
offing
.
###
One
of
these
is
Jeffrey
L.
Beach
,
director
of
research
for
Underwood
Neuhaus
&
Co.
,
a
brokerage
house
in
Houston
,
who
thinks
that
``
we
're
either
in
a
recession
or
about
to
go
into
one
.
''
###
What
's
more
,
he
thinks
this
could
be
a
nastier
recession
than
usual
:
``
Once
the
downturn
comes
,
it
's
going
to
be
very
hard
to
reverse
.
''
###
Investors
,
he
advises
,
``
should
be
cautious
,
''
holding
fewer
stocks
than
usual
and
also
shunning
bonds
.
###
Because
he
sees
``
5
%
to
6
%
base
rate
of
inflation
in
the
economy
,
''
he
doubts
that
interest
rates
will
fall
much
any
time
soon
.
###
Instead
,
Mr.
Beach
says
,
investors
``
probably
should
be
carrying
a
very
high
level
of
cash
,
''
by
which
he
means
such
so-called
cash
equivalents
as
money-market
funds
and
Treasury
bills
.
###
Greg
Confair
,
president
of
Sigma
Financial
Inc.
in
Allentown
,
Pa.
,
also
recommends
that
investors
go
heavily
for
cash
.
###
He
is
n't
sure
a
recession
is
coming
,
but
says
the
other
likely
alternative
--
reignited
inflation
--
is
just
as
bad
.
###
``
This
late
in
an
expansion
,
''
the
economy
tends
to
veer
off
either
into
damaging
inflation
or
into
a
recession
,
Mr.
Confair
says
.
###
The
Federal
Reserve
Board
's
plan
for
a
``
soft
landing
,
''
he
says
,
requires
the
Fed
to
navigate
``
an
ever-narrowing
corridor
.
''
###
A
soft
landing
is
n't
something
that
can
be
achieved
once
and
for
all
,
Mr.
Confair
adds
.
###
It
has
to
be
engineered
over
and
over
again
,
month
after
month
.
###
He
believes
that
the
task
facing
Fed
Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
is
so
difficult
that
it
resembles
``
juggling
a
double-bladed
ax
and
a
buzz
saw
.
''
###
And
,
in
a
sense
,
that
's
the
kind
of
task
individuals
face
in
deciding
what
to
do
about
stocks
--
the
mainstay
of
most
serious
investors
'
portfolios
.
###
It
comes
down
to
a
question
of
whether
to
try
to
``
time
''
the
market
.
###
For
people
who
can
ride
out
market
waves
through
good
times
and
bad
,
stocks
have
been
rewarding
long-term
investments
.
###
Most
studies
show
that
buy-and-hold
investors
historically
have
earned
an
annual
return
from
stocks
of
9
%
to
10
%
,
including
both
dividends
and
price
appreciation
.
###
That
's
well
above
what
bonds
or
bank
certificates
have
paid
.
###
Moreover
,
because
no
one
knows
for
sure
just
when
a
recession
is
coming
,
some
analysts
think
investors
should
n't
even
worry
too
much
about
timing
.
###
``
Trying
to
time
the
economy
is
a
mistake
,
''
says
David
Katz
,
chief
investment
officer
of
Value
Matrix
Management
Inc.
in
New
York
.
###
Mr.
Katz
notes
that
some
economists
have
been
predicting
a
recession
for
at
least
two
years
.
###
Investors
who
listened
,
and
lightened
up
on
stocks
,
``
have
just
hurt
themselves
,
''
he
says
.
###
Mr.
Katz
adds
that
people
who
jump
in
and
out
of
the
stock
market
need
to
be
right
about
70
%
of
the
time
to
beat
a
buy-and-hold
strategy
.
###
Frequent
trading
runs
up
high
commission
costs
.
###
And
the
in-and-outer
might
miss
the
sudden
spurts
that
account
for
much
of
the
stock
market
's
gains
over
time
.
###
Still
,
few
investors
are
able
to
sit
tight
when
they
are
convinced
a
recession
is
coming
.
###
After
all
,
in
all
five
recessions
since
1960
,
stocks
declined
.
###
According
to
Ned
Davis
,
president
of
Ned
Davis
Research
Inc.
in
Nokomis
,
Fla.
,
the
average
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
was
about
21
%
,
and
the
decrease
began
an
average
of
six
months
before
a
recession
officially
started
.
###
By
the
time
a
recession
is
``
official
''
-LRB-
two
consecutive
quarters
of
declining
gross
national
product
-RRB-
,
much
of
the
damage
to
stocks
has
already
been
done-and
,
in
the
typical
case
,
the
recession
is
already
half
over
.
###
About
six
months
before
a
recession
ends
,
stocks
typically
begin
to
rise
again
,
as
investors
anticipate
a
recovery
.
###
The
average
recession
lasts
about
a
year
.
###
Unfortunately
,
though
,
recessions
vary
enough
in
length
so
that
the
average
ca
n't
reliably
be
used
to
guide
investors
in
timing
stock
sales
or
purchases
.
###
But
whatever
their
advice
about
timing
,
none
of
these
experts
recommend
jettisoning
stocks
entirely
during
a
recession
.
###
For
the
portion
of
an
investor
's
portfolio
that
stays
in
stocks
,
professionals
have
a
number
of
suggestions
.
###
Mr.
Katz
advocates
issues
with
low
price-earnings
ratios
--
that
is
,
low
prices
in
relation
to
the
company
's
earnings
per
share
.
###
``
Low
P-E
''
stocks
,
he
says
,
vastly
outperform
others
``
during
a
recession
or
bear
market
.
''
###
In
good
times
,
he
says
,
they
lag
a
bit
,
but
overall
they
provide
superior
performance
.
###
Prof.
Arbel
urges
investors
to
discard
stocks
in
small
companies
.
###
Small-company
shares
typically
fall
more
than
big-company
stocks
in
a
recession
,
he
says
.
###
And
in
any
case
,
he
argues
,
stocks
of
small
companies
are
``
almost
as
overpriced
as
they
were
Sept.
30
,
1987
,
just
before
the
crash
.
''
###
For
example
,
Mr.
Arbel
says
,
stocks
of
small
companies
are
selling
for
about
19
times
cash
flow
.
###
Cash
flow
,
basically
earnings
plus
depreciation
,
is
one
common
gauge
of
a
company
's
financial
health
.
-RRB-
###
That
ratio
is
dangerously
close
to
the
ratio
of
19.7
that
prevailed
before
the
1987
stock-market
crash
,
Mr.
Arbel
says
.
###
And
it
's
way
above
the
ratio
-LRB-
7.5
times
cash
flow
-RRB-
that
bigger
companies
are
selling
for
.
###
Another
major
trick
in
making
a
portfolio
recession-resistant
is
choosing
stocks
in
``
defensive
''
industries
.
###
Food
,
tobacco
,
drugs
and
utilities
are
the
classic
examples
.
###
Recession
or
not
,
people
still
eat
,
smoke
,
and
take
medicine
when
they
're
sick
.
###
George
Putnam
III
,
editor
of
Turnaround
Letter
in
Boston
,
offers
one
final
tip
for
recession-wary
investors
.
###
``
Keep
some
money
available
for
opportunities
,
''
he
says
.
###
``
If
the
recession
does
hit
,
there
will
be
some
great
investment
opportunities
just
when
things
seem
the
blackest
.

&
North
Western
is
one
of
the
so-called
good
junk-bond
offerings
on
the
new-issue
calendar
.
###
Some
analysts
said
the
restructuring
of
the
railroad
concern
's
issue
shows
how
tough
it
is
for
underwriters
to
sell
even
the
junk
bonds
of
a
company
considered
to
be
a
relatively
good
credit
risk
.
###
Since
last
week
's
junk-bond
market
debacle
,
many
new
issues
of
high-yield
,
high-risk
corporate
bonds
have
either
been
scaled
back
,
delayed
or
dropped
.
###
On
Wednesday
,
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.
had
to
slash
the
size
of
Continental
Airlines
'
junk-bond
offering
to
$
71
million
from
$
150
million
.
###
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
has
delayed
Grand
Union
Co.
's
$
1.16
billion
junk-bond
offering
while
it
restructures
the
transaction
.
###
Last
week
,
the
Grand
Union
offering
was
sweetened
to
include
warrants
that
allow
bondholders
to
acquire
common
stock
.
###
Prudential-Bache
said
the
York
issue
was
delayed
because
of
market
conditions
.
###
``
Everything
is
going
through
firehoops
right
now
,
and
-LCB-
Chicago
&
North
Western
-RCB-
is
no
exception
,
''
said
Mariel
Clemensen
,
vice
president
,
high-yield
research
,
at
Citicorp
.
###
Portfolio
managers
say
sweeteners
like
equity
kickers
and
stricter
protective
covenants
may
increasingly
be
required
to
sell
junk-bond
deals
.
###
Dan
Baldwin
,
managing
director
of
high-yield
investments
at
Chancellor
Capital
Management
,
said
the
Chicago
&
North
Western
offering
was
restructured
in
part
because
``
several
large
insurance
buyers
right
now
are
demanding
equity
as
part
of
the
package
.
###
If
you
're
going
to
take
the
risk
in
this
market
,
you
want
something
extra
.
''
###
Mr.
Baldwin
likes
the
offering
.
###
But
several
mutual-fund
managers
,
nervous
about
the
deteriorating
quality
of
their
junk-bond
portfolios
and
shy
about
buying
new
issues
,
said
they
're
staying
away
from
any
junk
security
that
is
n't
considered
first
rate
for
its
class
.
###
While
they
consider
the
Chicago
&
North
Western
issue
to
be
good
,
they
do
n't
view
it
as
the
best
.
###
To
lure
buyers
to
the
Chicago
&
North
Western
bonds
,
portfolio
managers
said
Donaldson
Lufkin
sweetened
the
transaction
by
offering
the
bonds
with
a
resettable
interest
rate
and
a
10
%
equity
kicker
.
###
The
bonds
are
expected
to
have
a
14
%
coupon
rate
.
###
The
equity
arrangement
apparently
would
allow
bondholders
to
buy
a
total
of
10
%
of
the
stock
of
CNW
Corp.
,
Chicago
&
North
Western
's
parent
company
.
###
Donaldson
Lufkin
declined
to
comment
on
the
restructuring
.
###
According
to
some
analysts
familiar
with
the
negotiations
,
the
10
%
of
equity
would
come
directly
from
Donaldson
Lufkin
and
a
fund
affiliated
with
the
investment
bank
Blackstone
Group
,
which
would
reduce
their
CNW
equity
holdings
by
5
%
each
.
###
That
would
leave
the
Blackstone
fund
with
a
60
%
stake
and
Donaldson
Lufkin
with
15
%
.
###
Despite
the
problems
with
new
issues
,
high-yield
bonds
showed
gains
in
the
secondary
,
or
resell
,
market
.
###
Junk
bonds
ended
about
one-half
point
higher
with
so-called
high-quality
issues
from
RJR
Capital
Holdings
Corp.
and
Petrolane
Gas
Service
Limited
Partnership
rising
one
point
.
###
In
the
Treasury
market
,
the
benchmark
30-year
bond
rose
seven-eighths
point
,
or
$
8.75
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
.
###
The
gain
reflects
fresh
economic
evidence
that
inflation
is
moderating
while
the
economy
slows
.
###
That
raised
hopes
that
interest
rates
will
continue
to
move
lower
.
###
The
Labor
Department
reported
that
consumer
prices
rose
just
0.2
%
last
month
,
slightly
lower
than
some
economists
had
expected
.
###
But
there
were
also
rumors
yesterday
that
several
Japanese
institutional
investors
were
shifting
their
portfolios
and
buying
long-term
bonds
while
selling
shorter-term
Treasurys
.
###
Short-term
Treasury
securities
ended
narrowly
mixed
,
with
two-year
notes
posting
slight
declines
while
three-year
notes
were
slightly
higher
.
###
Yesterday
,
the
Fed
executed
four-day
matched
sales
,
a
technical
trading
operation
designed
to
drain
reserves
from
the
banking
system
.
###
The
move
was
interpreted
by
some
economists
as
a
sign
that
the
Fed
does
n't
want
the
federal
funds
rate
to
move
any
lower
than
the
8
%
at
which
it
has
been
hovering
around
during
the
past
week
.
###
The
closely
watched
funds
rate
is
what
banks
charge
each
other
on
overnight
loans
.
###
It
is
considered
an
early
signal
of
Fed
credit
policy
changes
.
###
``
The
fact
that
they
did
four-day
matched
sales
means
they
are
not
in
a
mood
to
ease
aggressively
.
###
They
are
telling
us
that
-LCB-
8
%
-RCB-
is
as
low
as
they
want
to
see
the
fed
funds
rate
,
''
said
Robert
Chandross
at
Lloyds
Bank
PLC
.
###
The
benchmark
30-year
bond
was
quoted
late
at
a
price
of
101
to
yield
7.955
%
,
compared
with
100
to
yield
8.032
%
Wednesday
.
###
The
latest
10-year
notes
were
quoted
late
at
100
to
yield
7.937
%
,
compared
with
99
to
yield
8.007
%
.
###
Short-term
rates
rose
yesterday
.
###
The
discount
rate
on
three-month
Treasury
bills
rose
to
7.56
%
from
7.51
%
Wednesday
,
while
the
rate
on
six-month
bills
rose
to
7.57
%
from
7.53
%
.
###
Meanwhile
,
the
Treasury
sold
$
9.75
billion
of
52-week
bills
yesterday
.
###
The
average
yield
on
the
bills
was
7.35
%
,
down
from
7.61
%
at
the
previous
52-week
bill
auction
Sept.
21
.
###
Yesterday
's
yield
was
the
lowest
since
7.22
%
on
July
27
.
###
Here
are
details
of
the
auction
:
###
Rates
are
determined
by
the
difference
between
the
purchase
price
and
face
value
.
###
Thus
,
higher
bidding
narrows
the
investor
's
return
while
lower
bidding
widens
it
.
###
The
percentage
rates
are
calculated
on
a
360-day
year
,
while
the
coupon-equivalent
yield
is
based
on
a
365-day
year
.
###
Junk
bond
price
climbed
yesterday
despite
skittishness
in
the
new-issue
market
for
high-yield
securities
.
###
Dealers
said
junk
bond
issues
on
average
were
up
by
to
point
with
so-called
quality
issues
from
RJR
Capital
Holdings
Corp.
and
Petrolane
Gas
Service
Limited
Partnership
posting
one-point
gains
.
###
Petrolane
Gas
Service
's
13
%
debentures
traded
at
102
,
after
trading
around
par
earlier
this
week
,
and
RJR
's
13
%
subordinated
debentures
of
2001
were
at
101
after
trading
at
below
par
earlier
this
week
.
###
Investment-grade
bonds
were
unchanged
.
###
Activity
was
brisk
in
the
high-grade
general
obligation
market
,
as
a
series
of
sell
lists
hit
the
Street
and
capped
upward
price
movement
in
the
sector
.
###
Traders
estimated
that
more
than
$
140
million
of
high-grade
bonds
was
put
up
for
sale
via
bid-wanted
lists
circulated
by
a
handful
of
major
brokers
.
###
There
was
speculation
that
the
supply
was
coming
from
a
commercial
bank
's
portfolios
.
###
According
to
market
participants
,
the
bonds
were
met
with
decent
bids
,
but
the
volume
of
paper
left
high
grades
in
the
10-year
and
under
maturity
range
unchanged
to
0.05
percentage
point
higher
in
yield
.
###
Away
from
the
general
obligation
sector
,
activity
was
modest
.
###
Long
dollar
bonds
were
flat
to
up
point
.
###
New
Jersey
Turnpike
Authority
's
7.20
%
issue
of
2018
was
up
at
98
bid
to
yield
about
7.32
%
,
down
0.03
percentage
point
.
###
The
debt
of
some
California
issuers
pulled
off
lows
reached
after
Tuesday
's
massive
earthquake
,
although
traders
said
market
participants
remained
cautious
.
###
California
expects
to
rely
on
federal
emergency
funds
and
its
$
1.06
billion
in
general
fund
reserves
to
meet
the
estimated
$
500
million
to
$
1
billion
in
damages
resulting
from
the
quake
,
according
to
a
state
official
.
###
It
's
also
unclear
precisely
how
the
state
will
rebuild
its
reserve
,
said
Cindy
Katz
,
assistant
director
of
California
's
department
of
finance
,
although
she
noted
that
a
bond
offering
for
that
purpose
is
n't
anticipated
.
###
Meanwhile
,
new
issuance
was
slow
.
###
The
largest
sale
in
the
competitive
arena
was
a
$
55.7
million
issue
of
school
financing
bonds
from
the
Virginia
Public
School
Authority
.
###
A
balance
of
$
25.8
million
remained
in
late
order-taking
,
according
to
the
lead
manager
.
###
Mortgage
securities
generally
ended
to
point
higher
,
but
lagged
gains
in
the
Treasury
market
because
of
a
shift
in
the
shape
of
the
Treasury
yield
curve
and
rumored
mortgage
sales
by
thrifts
.
###
Premium
Government
National
Mortgage
Association
securities
with
coupon
rates
of
13
%
and
higher
actually
declined
amid
concerns
about
increased
prepayments
because
of
a
plan
being
considered
by
Congress
to
speed
the
refinancing
of
government-subsidized
mortgages
.
###
Ginnie
Mae
13
%
securities
were
down
about
at
109
.
###
If
the
refinancing
plan
clears
Congress
,
there
could
be
fairly
heavy
prepayments
on
the
premium
securities
,
hurting
any
investor
paying
much
above
par
for
them
.
###
In
the
current-coupon
sector
,
a
shift
in
the
Treasury
yield
curve
resulting
from
the
better
performance
of
long-dated
issues
over
short-dated
securities
hurt
major
coupons
because
it
will
become
more
difficult
to
structure
new
derivative
securities
offerings
.
###
Ginnie
Mae

securities
ended

98

up

###
%
to
a
12-year
average
life
assumption
,
as
the
spread
above
the
Treasury
10-year
note
widened
0.03
percentage
point
to
1.48
.
###
While
Remic
issuance
may
slow
in
the
coming
days
because
of
the
shift
in
the
Treasury
yield
curve
,
underwriters
continued
to
crank
out
new
real
estate
mortgage
investment
conduits
structured
when
the
yield
curve
was
more
favorable
.
###
Two
new
Remics
totaling
$
900
million
were
announced
by
Freddie
Mac
yesterday
.
###
British
government
bonds
ended
little
changed
as
investors
awaited
an
economic
policy
address
last
night
by
Chancellor
of
the

.
###
The
Treasury
11

due
was
down
at

to
yield
10.09

,
while
the
