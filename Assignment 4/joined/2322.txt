 West Indies require 241 more runs today to win the first Test against Australia with nine wickets in hand. The hosts moved on to 46 for one in their second innings, chasing a target of 287, before taking the light early in the evening session of the fourth day at Sabina Park. Brenton Parchment (15) was the only West Indian to fall, drawing his bat away too late from a Stuart Clark delivery, with Brad Haddin making no mistake behind the stumps. Australia were restricted to 167 all out in their second innings, with Dwayne Bravo claiming four for 47, including the wicket of Andrew Symonds. The 32-year-old was the only player to offer any resistance but his dismissal for 79 signalled the beginning of the end for the tourists. Brad Hodge (27) and Haddin (23) were the only other Australians to reach double figures. Symonds came to the crease at 18 for five and looked in determined mood following his 70 not out in the first innings but after he was held by Darren Sammy at mid-on the Australian innings petered out. The holders Durham dodged the Sunday rain to beat Scotland by 38 runs in a vital Friends Provident Trophy match. Victory maintained Durham's slim chance of reaching the quarter-finals. Surrey kept open a path to the last eight, beating Essex by eight wickets at Chelmsford. Essex remain in a strong position to qualify. In the south/west group Worcestershire beat Glamorgan by seven wickets. And Gloucestershire are almost guaranteed to make the knockout stage after beating Hampshire with two balls to spare in a 20-over slog. The former England seamer Darren Gough, 37, is to retire at the end of the season. "I think it's time now," said the Yorkshire captain. "I think I've had a good innings and it's time to call it a day."
