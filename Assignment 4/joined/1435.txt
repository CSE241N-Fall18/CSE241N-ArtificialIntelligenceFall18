 It’s good that Bob Kerslake, former head of the home civil service and a permanent secretary, has suggested that prime ministers should be denied the right to a resignation honours list (Report, 8 August). Will he also campaign against senior civil servants, like himself, automatically being given peerages upon retirement and some government and other posts attracting damehoods or knighthoods for the holder by the mere fact of holding them?Terry PhilpotLimpsfield Chart, Surrey • Mike Pender (Letters, 10 August) recalls that Leonard Cohen reduced many women to tears when he sang So Long, Marianne in Cardiff in 2008. As one of the tearful participants in the event that night, I can confirm that numerous men in the audience were similarly affected by Mr Cohen, including my husband, Mike Pender.Beverley MasonCardiff • Lucy Mangan (Notebook, 10 August) has a vision of a club where people can pop in and read a book, sit in silence or daydream for 20 minutes, without having to queue or buy a coffee. These are known as libraries and are great places. And to think anyone would want to close them?Alan HagueBeverley, East Yorkshire • John Patterson’s review of Wiener-Dog (The Guide, 6 August) concludes with “Solondz seems trapped, wallowing in the same miserablist whirlpool of his own devising, with no noticeable cinematic growth”. On the back page, it claims that the Guardian has awarded it four stars. In the words of the immortal George Cole, “What is occurring, Terence?”Alan Woodley Northampton • Could this possibly beat the gorgonzola ice-cream I enjoyed in Turin some years ago? Complimented by a Dolcetto ice-cream (Cheesy ice-cream takes Czech town by storm, 10 August)!Albert BeckettOswaldtwistle, Lancashire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@
