Only a group of academics with exalted titles could compose such a convoluted letter bereft of intellectual rigour (Science Museum must drop oil sponsorship, 11 October). The points they raise are important, but largely unrelated. Should entrance to all areas of the Science Museum be free for all? Absolutely. Should the museum have an exhibit sponsored by an oil company? Yes. Oil companies provide critical products to our society and the Science Museum has every right to try and gain income from them. The actions of companies that impact society and the environment negatively need to be questioned and challenged. But to damn all oil companies from pursuing their core activities is completely misplaced. Climate change is an important issue that must urgently be addressed. However, this is most effectively achieved by providing globally accessible, clean, low-cost alternatives. It is the world’s leaders and politicians that need to be criticised for the lack of progress in this area, not the Science Museum or our current energy suppliers.Dr David WilliamsTunbridge Wells, Kent • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@
