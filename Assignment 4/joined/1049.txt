 Dundee United have announced their head coach Mixu Paatelainen has left the club following their relegation from the Scottish Premiership. The 49-year-old Finn’s position was always likely to be under threat after a disappointing season ended with defeat to the local rivals Dundee on Monday which confirmed they would be playing Championship football next season. Appointed in October, the former Hibernian, Kilmarnock and Finland manager could not turn things around for the club where he played as a striker for five years. “I would like to thank the players, staff and supporters,” Paatelainen said. “It has been a difficult winter and the challenge was huge but nevertheless I have enjoyed every day working for the club and with this group of players.” A short statement on the Terrors’ website confirmed his departure, with the club now beginning the process of finding a replacement. “Dundee United Football Club and Mixu Paatelainen have agreed the departure of Paatelainen as first team head coach with immediate effect,” it read. “The club thanks Mixu for his service and will now begin the search for a new head coach.” The Raith Rovers manager Ray McKinnon has already been linked with the position but the Championship club are keen to keep the former United midfielder in charge as they go in search of promotion. Eric Drysdale, a director at Rovers, said: “We have not had any contact from Dundee United or any other club regarding Ray McKinnon. “And should any be forthcoming it would be extremely unwelcome. Ray and the team are fully concentrated on the play-off matches against Hibernian and nothing will distract them from this.”
