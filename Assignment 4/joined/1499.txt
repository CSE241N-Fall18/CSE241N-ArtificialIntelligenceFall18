Buying in the larger M&S stores is like entering a jungle (M&S to close 30 stores, 9 November). It’s exhausting. You go in looking for a pair of trousers but these are in at least four or five areas, from Autograph to Per Una and the Classic section. You don’t know if you have seen everything. The answer is to redesign the layout of the whole stock. Return to having areas that deal with one item only – for example, a coat section, a trouser section etc. Within each there could be diverse styles and clearcolour-coding of sizes. Then we could make a beeline for what we wanted. People haven’t the time or energy to search and search. Quality of materials has been sacrificed in order to keep prices down, and some styles are a bit uninspiring. More checkouts too, though the staff there are helpful and courteous. We do need M&S.Christina NaylorLanguenan, France • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@ • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
