Burberry’s latest advert looks like something Julian Fellowes would watch on his laptop without any pants on. It is a lavish three-minute trailer for a period drama that will never be made. Directed by Asif Kapadia and starring Sienna Miller, Domhnall Gleeson, Dominic West and Lily James, it tells the story of the company’s founder Thomas Burberry as he kits out various figures from history: Ernest Shackleton, Betty Dawson (based on pilot Betty Kirby-Green) and first world war soldiers. Cleverly, the makers have only told the very beginning of the Burberry story, meaning there’s plenty of room for sequels. The next one could chronicle a more contemporary period in the brand’s history – say, 2001, with a man wearing a Burberry cap mugging an old lady for her Nokia 3310.  For all its nostalgia, though, the advert does feel like something new – as if we’ve started down the line to a Brookerian future where all feature films are made by brands. It can therefore only be a matter of time before we get a Sophie’s Choice remake by John Lewis, in which Meryl Streep has to choose between a beloved child and a four-slot chrome toaster.
