Bryan Singer is set to direct Bohemian Rhapsody, a biopic focusing on the band Queen and their frontman Freddie Mercury. Singer, best known for directing The Usual Suspects and four films in the X-Men franchise, is the latest name attached to the project, according to Deadline.  The biopic has been in development for eight years, and Tom Hooper, Stephen Frears and Dexter Fletcher have all previously been linked to the director’s chair. It was announced last week that Mercury, who died in 1991, will be played by Mr Robot star Rami Malek. Singer said in an Instagram post on Saturday that he was looking forward to Malek playing the role.  #bohemianrhapsody #queen #freddiemercury #brianmay #rogertaylor #johndeacon #grahamking #fox #newregency Looking forward to @ramimalek @whoismrrobot playing #Freddie photo @therealmickrock A photo posted by Bryan Singer (@bryanjaysinger) on Nov 4, 2016 at 3:23pm PDT Sacha Baron Cohen and Ben Whishaw have previously been cast in the role of Mercury, but both plans fell apart due to creative differences.  Baron Cohen said that Queen members Roger Taylor and Brian May, who are working as music producers on the film, had different ideas about how much of the film should be focused on Mercury. May later denied the claim, saying Baron Cohen “became an arse”. The film is scheduled to begin shooting early next year.
