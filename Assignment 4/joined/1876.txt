• Guardiola says that talks are ongoing but clubs yet to agree on fee• Manchester City manager sees side lose friendly to Bayern Munich Agencies 
 The Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has confirmed that the club are in talks with Schalke forward Leroy Sané but the move is stalling over the player’s valuation. The Spaniard was speaking after his side’s 1-0 defeat to his former club away at Bayern Munich in a friendly, his first game in charge of the English club. “Sané is a player of Schalke. Of course we talk to him - Schalke knows we are interested, but at this moment we don’t have many possibilities to get him,” Guardiola told reporters. “There is a difference between Manchester City and Schalke and it is quite big. I do not know what is going to happen but right now he is with Schalke,” he said of the 20-year-old Sané, who was in the Germany squad at Euro 2016. Schalke’s sporting director, Christian Heidel, has confirmed Sane has asked the club for a transfer. Sané scored eight goals for Schalke last season as the Bundesliga club finished fifth in the league. Guardiola spent three seasons coaching Bayern and won the Bundesliga title in each season, but missed out on the Champions League trophy. He declined to extend his contract at the end of last season and was replaced by Carlo Ancelotti. The two coaches embraced after Wednesday’s match, which was played at a leisurely pace, with both sides missing many regulars. The only goal of the game came from Erdal Özturk in the 76th minute when a clearance bounced off the referee and fell kindly to Özturk, whose shot was deflected by Gaël Clichy.
