Leading shares are on track for their biggest daily rise since the end of September, as investors welcomed news that Hillary Clinton was cleared by the latest FBI probe, raising her chances of victory against Donald Trump. Mining and banking shares are heading the risers as investors piled back into riskier assets, with BHP Billiton 47p better at £12.13 and Antofagasta adding 21.5p to 553p. But with gold and silver slipping back, Randgold Resources is down 95p at £66.95 and Fresnillo has fallen 31p to £15.94. Amid the banking stocks, HSBC is 26.8p higher at 621.6p following its latest update, but Tesco has dropped 2.15p to 200.35p after its banking service was hit by fraudulent activity. Overall the FTSE 100 has climbed 103.27 points to 6796.53, with its exporters and overseas earners helped by a boost to the dollar from the latest US election news. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said:  In yet another extraordinary twist in what has already been the most dramatic US election campaign ever, the clearing of Clinton has seen confidence return to equity markets and safe havens slump, as the market starts to price in a Hilary victory. However, while the polls have widened and the expectation is that the US electorate will deliver a Trump defeat, many investors are still sitting on significant levels of cash as the possibility of a surprise Brexit-like result is simply too risky to contemplate - with the upside potential of a Clinton victory markedly lower than the downside risk of a Trump win. Elsewhere insurer Lancashire Holdings is heading the mid-cap fallers, down 16p to 704p after analysts at Bernstein cut their recommendation from market perform to underperform after its recent results.
