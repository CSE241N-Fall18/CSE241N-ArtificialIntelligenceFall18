 Meg Hillier is quoted (Report, 27 July) as saying that “further cuts to spending on HMRC’s customer service will chill the blood of many taxpayers”.

One hopes that along with her son, the equally great Andrew Gold, she’s singing – exquisitely – the title of one of Andrew’s wonderful albums All This and Heaven Too!Jon CorfieldBirmingham • I was surprised that Paul Evans (Country diary, 27 July) did not mention Ted Hughes’ Thistles: “They are like the pale hair and the gutturals of dialects./ Every one manages a plume of blood.// Then they grow grey like men.”Steve TillAlton, Hampshire • The normally well-informed Keith Flett (Letters, 26 July) has obviously not been reading the Guardian fashion columns. Socks with sandals are OK for men in 2016 (Report, 6 May).Jane SutherlandReading • Patrick Butterly writes that adults who’ve retained the “carefree joy, curiosity, resilience and magic of childhood” are called scientists (Letters, 28 July).

Picasso (Letters, 27 July)? Non! Yves Klein!Carolyn KirtonAberdeen • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@
