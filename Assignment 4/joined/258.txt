 The highlight of Jeremy Corbyn’s latest speech now appears to be the imperceptible “smile” he allegedly let loose during the brief booing of a journalist. The Sun has even promoted the Telegraph’s “smile” to a “smirk”. Mail on Sunday columnist Dan Hodges thinks it was a “grin”. So that the parameters of appropriate personal expression may be known to one and all, perhaps this headline-worthy “smile”, like the insufficient depth of Corbyn’s bow at the Cenotaph, could be measured, frame by frame?Peter McKennaLiverpool  • I wish neoliberalism were dying, as Aditya Chakrabortty claims (Opinion, 31 May). But isn’t privatisation of the Land Registry evidence to the contrary?Alec GordonLondon • Janet Russell (Letters, 30 May) is totally correct in her assessment of the importance of women in protesting against fracking. It is significant that the council chosen to decide about licensing fracking was all male, majority Tory and no doubt grey-suited.Anne FieldingGrannies Against FrackingLytham St Annes, Lancashire • I have to disagree that “it’s a bit of a tall order to be a role model and a believable character in a sitcom” (Opinion, 2 June). Wolfie Smith and Victor Meldrew have both been admirable role models for me, albeit at different times of life.Jeremy ScroxtonThames Ditton, Surrey • Here in my area of south-east Wales, the alleys are called the “back”. As in “come round the back when you come”. Back meaning “back alley”. Still part of everyday use (Letters, 1 June).Catherine HarrisBargoed, Caerphilly • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@
