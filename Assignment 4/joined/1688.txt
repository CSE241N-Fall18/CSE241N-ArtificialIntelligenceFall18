Volkswagen faces €8.2bn (7bn) of damages claims from investors over its emissions scandal in the legal district where the carmaker is based.  About 1,400 lawsuits have been lodged at the regional court in Braunschweig near VW’s Wolfsburg headquarters, the court said. It added that it received about 750 lawsuits on Monday alone, the first business day after the anniversary of VW’s diesel emissions test-rigging scandal.  The court brought in extra staff to process suits submitted by shareholders concerned that 18 September – the date VW’s manipulations were disclosed a year ago – could be the deadline to file.  Plaintiffs say the German carmaker did not inform shareholders quickly enough over its cheating software, which was installed in up to 11m vehicles wordwide.  VW, which faces lawsuits and investigations around the world, insists it did not break capital markets regulations in the disclosure of its cheating.  The biggest claim at the Braunschweig court, totalling €3.3bn, was filed by lawyer Andreas Tulip on behalf of institutional investors about six months ago.  The court detailed additional complaints on Wednesday, including a filing by institutional investors for €30m in damages, two investor groups demanding €1.5bn and €550m respectively and an investment company that sued the carmaker for €45m.  It would take about four weeks to fully process the additional claims, the court said. Complaints have also been filed by German state pension funds.  VW has set aside about $18bn (£14bn) to cover the cost of vehicle refits and a settlement with US authorities, but analysts predict the bill could rise much further as a result of lawsuits and regulatory penalties.
