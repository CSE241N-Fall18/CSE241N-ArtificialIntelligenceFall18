Angelina Jolie will continue to have sole custody of her six children with Brad Pitt in a joint agreement reached by the actors, a representative for the actress has said. The agreement calls for the former couple’s six children, who range in ages from eight to 15, to continue to have “therapeutic visits” with Pitt. Jolie filed for divorce in September, days after Pitt was involved in a disturbance during a private flight with his family. She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the breakup, and an attorney said at the time she filed for divorce “for the health of the family.” The new statement said the agreement was reached more than a week ago in consultation with childcare professionals. It says no further details could be provided, and it makes no mention of an investigation by child welfare workers into the plane incident. Pitt and Jolie reached a temporary custody agreement in late September that included at least some of the same terms – visitation with his children and both sides agreeing to meetings with therapists. “We believe that all sides are committed to healing the family and ask for your consideration during this difficult time,” the statement said. A representative for Pitt declined comment. The actor filed a legal response to the divorce on 4 November and sought joint custody of the children. Whether a judge will have to weigh in on the agreement was not known, although many parents are able to reach custody agreements without a formal hearing. Pitt’s filing does not include new details about the couple’s breakup. Pitt cited irreconcilable differences and makes no mention of a prenuptial agreement that will govern how the pair divides their assets. He also cites 15 September as the day of their separation, one day after the alleged plane altercation between Pitt and his 15-year-old son, Maddox.  The actors were married for two years and together for 12 years after becoming close while filming 2005’s Mr & Mrs Smith.
