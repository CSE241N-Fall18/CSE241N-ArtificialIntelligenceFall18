Malcolm Turnbull has been given another gift for the anniversary of his first year as prime minister – the lowest jobless rate in three years. The unemployment rate unexpectedly declined to 5.6% in August when economists had expected it to stay at 5.7%, as fewer people sought a job. The fall came despite overall employment dropping by 3,900 in the month as 11,500 new full-time workers was more than offset by a decline in part-time positions. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said any reduction in the unemployment rate was welcome, but noted the fall in both employment and the participation rate of those in work or actively seeking employment. “Where you have an unemployment rate being brought down by the participation rate ... that is not the ideal way to say it’s a reduction,” he said in Canberra. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, preferred to look at the performance of the labour market over the past year, which has seen the jobless rate drop from 6.1% while adding 180,000 new jobs to the workforce. In the last year of the Labor government 86,000 new jobs were created. “On any analysis, when it comes to job creation, jobs are being created at a much more rapid rate under a Coalition government,” Senator Cash said. Tasmania recorded the nation’s highest unemployment rate for August, leaping by almost one percentage point on the previous month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 7.2%. Unions Tasmania secretary Steve Walsh said of the figures: “By any measure this state is now clearly in a jobs crisis.”
