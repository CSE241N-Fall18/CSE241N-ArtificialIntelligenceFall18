John Oliver has taken aim at the FBI’s renewed investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails and the connection with disgraced politician Anthony Weiner. In his HBO show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, he referred to this year’s election as “the shit-filled cornucopia that just keeps on giving 2016”. He joked: “Bacardi should really consider switching their slogan to Bacardi: because there might be more fucking Clinton emails.” Oliver expressed suspicion over the FBI announcing their decision to investigate emails found on a laptop used by Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin, the estranged wife of Weiner. “OK so nine days out from the election, the FBI has basically delivered us the equivalent of a mystery box and like the box from the end of Seven – it could contain anything from nothing to Gwyneth Paltrow’s head,” he said. “Although it almost definitely contains Anthony Weiner’s penis.” The reason behind the discovery also led to Oliver calling this out as a new low for a particularly controversial election “The grinding hell of this election has thrown in yet another twist with the election potentially hanging in the balance,” he said. “All thanks to the fact that Anthony Weiner allegedly sexted with a 15-year-old girl.” Oliver continued: “Now, a month ago when Donald Trump tweeted we should check out a sex tape of a former Miss Universe contestant, I said if you looked up, you would see rock bottom. Well if you look up now, you will see absolutely nothing and I’ll tell you why: we have burrowed through, not just rock bottom, but through the core of the earth and we’ve come bursting out the other side, startling kangaroos and we’re currently hurtling toward outer space and there is no up, down, light or darkness, just an endless void in which death comes as sweet, sweet relief. Please let this thing be over soon.”
