  Tennis  The All England Club is opening its grass courts to children and juniors for the first time in an effort to produce future Wimbledon champions.  The home of Wimbledon has launched a junior coaching initiative to encourage children to stay in the sport and set an example to other clubs. Britain's No1 Tim Henman said the "Road to Wimbledon initiative makes the club more accessible for younger players. "If the premier club in the country is not doing anything [for juniors], then that is going to send out the wrong signals," he added. "We want to change that. Some of these youngsters will witness not just what goes on in the [Wimbledon] champi onships but what goes on at the club throughout the year." Around 1,200 local children will take part in tennis and general sport skills training sessions at the club and be given free coaching on most weekends, starting on May 12. In addition boys and girls under-14 from the 2,400 clubs affiliated to the Lawn Tennis Association will take part in singles competitions, with finals to be played at Wimbledon on August 19-24. The All England's chairman Tim Phillips said the club wanted more children to take up the sport: "If we are serious about wanting young people to play tennis, to stay in tennis and to dream of playing at Wimbledon, we must give them the opportunity to turn those dreams into reality."
