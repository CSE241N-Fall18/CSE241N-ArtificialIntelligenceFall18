Ken Loach’s I, Daniel Blake is up for seven prizes at the British independent film awards, including nominations for best film and best director. American Honey, Adult Life Skills, Notes on Blindness and Under the Shadow received six Bifanominations each. Loach’s film, which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes this year, is about a man trying to negotiate Britain’s labyrinthine benefits system. As well as the nominations for best film and director, it has picked up nominations for actors Dave Johns and Hayley Squires, who are also competing for the most promising newcomer award. Loach’s longtime collaborator Paul Laverty is nominated for best screenplay. This is the fifth time Loach has been nominated as best director at the Bifas, although he has not won since the inaugural edition of the awards in 1998, when he won for My Name Is Joe. Elsewhere, Andrea Arnold picked up her fourth best director nomination for American Honey, an award she won in 2009 for Fish Tank. Arnold is also nominated for best screenplay, and American Honey is nominated for best picture.  Michael Fassbender is nominated in the best actor category for Trespass Against Us. It is his third consecutive Bifa nomination and his sixth overall, with two victories in 2008 and 2011 for Hunger and Shame. The nominations for best international independent film are all high-profile choices: Maren Ade’s comedy-drama Toni Erdmann was a Palme d’Or favourite; Moonlight and Manchester By the Sea are likely Oscar contenders; Mustang was nominated for best foreign film at last year’s Oscars; and Hunt for the Wilderpeople has become New Zealand’s highest-grossing film. The winners will be announced on 4 December.
