So John Harris believes that there were once some halcyon days when “pop music was a great leveller” (Opinion, 16 November). In 1966, aged 15, when I was earning £6 10s 6d a week in my first job, a 45 rpm single cost about 6s 8d, and an LP £1 12s 6d. To buy the Beatles LP Revolver therefore cost me more or less a quarter of my wages. Looking back, the pop business was extraordinarily rapacious, screwing every last penny it could out of young pop pickers like me. And what did we get for that money? A piece of plastic and two bits of cardboard. No wonder the Beatles were travelling around in Rolls-Royces while I had to make do with the bus. The only egalitarianism at work was that millions of pop fans were equally ripped off.
