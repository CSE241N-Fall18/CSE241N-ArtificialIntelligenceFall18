Few people on the planet were left unaware on Thursday of Donald Trump’s electoral victory, two days after it happened. But six of them were locked up under 24/7 surveillance in a CBS television studio, contestants on Big Brother: Over the Top. Cut off from the outside world, the final six contestants, who are competing in a spin-off of the long-running reality TV show, were spared the rollercoaster of emotions the country, and the world, felt after Donald Trump was elected president. But their protective bubble burst when they were finally told the news during a live broadcast of the show on Thursday night. They were not happy.  “It’s pretty safe to say you are the only six people in the country, maybe the entire world, who do not know who won,” the ominous voice of host Julie Chen said as the contestants gathered around the couches. “The next president of the United States will be … Donald Trump. “I leave you with that, my house guests.” The #BBOTT Houseguests react to the results of the 2016 presidential election. pic.twitter.com/wWd6ZS9HSx The contestants let out a collective gasp and stared up at the cameras, their mouths gaping open at the news.  “What the fuck happened while we were in here?” contestant Shelby Stockton said.  “Something huge had to have happened,” Morgan Willett replied. “Gay people where were you? Minorities where were you?” said Jason Roy.  “It’s gonna be shit when we get out of here,” Justin Duncan said. “Can we just stay in here for the next four years?” Roy asked. This was the first season of the series to be aired during a presidential race. This is also the first season to air exclusively online. Contestants knew they were going to miss the election when they signed up to participate.  Contestant Duncan told Hollywood Reporter before he came on: “If Trump gets elected, the world is going to come to an end or something. We might get nuked or some shit. I’d rather Hillary. It’s like Hillary or die!”
