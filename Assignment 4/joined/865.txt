Glasgow, 17 October; Manchester, 18 October; London, 19 October  Just as Goat’s psychedelic pagan schtick was in danger of wearing thin, the masked Swedes’ third album Requiem finds them paring down the clatter for something folkier, flutier and, in places, oddly tender. Live, their hypnotic rock ragas provide all the fun of a frolicsome hippy cult without having to surrender your worldly possessions. Brighton, 17 October; London, 18 October; Bristol, 19 October; Glasgow, 20 October Like a live-band version of the Avalanches’ sampladelic frenzy, fellow Aussies Jagwar Ma offer egalitarian indie-dance grooves of the type rarely seen since the days of the Heavenly Social.

London, 15 October; Glasgow, 20 October; Manchester, 21 October; touring to 26 October With his comeback album Following My Intuition going straight in at No 1 last week, Craig David is once again all over your boink.
