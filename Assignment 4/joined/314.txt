 I am increasingly troubled by those individuals who are unable to accept the outcome of the referendum. On Monday I read a Daily Telegraph column by a man who, in a desperate attempt at irony, writes under the nom de plume “Boris Johnson”. “Boris” calls for European free trade, a single market, the right of people “to live; to travel; to study; to buy homes and to settle down” anywhere in the EU, and an “intense and intensifying European cooperation and partnership in a huge number of fields”. Will the Europhiles never give up? Do they not understand democracy? Accept it, “Boris”: your side lost.Dr Martin SpenceAssociate professor of history, Cornerstone University, Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA • David Cameron tells us that he has set up a new unit within the Cabinet Office to take forward our withdrawal from the EU. I had believed that part of the role of the civil service was to formulate strategies for dealing with foreseeable events which could be implemented immediately, thus avoiding the sort of chaos we have seen over the last few days. There were only two possible outcomes to this referendum: why were they not both properly prepared for?Jill CramphornLondon • May I suggest a special new section in Soulmates – for those Europeans keen to stay here, and for Europhiles like myself who would love a French, for example, husband. I would sign up tomorrow.(Miss) Susannah EveringtonBridport, Dorset • Richard II, Shakespeare: “That England that was wont to conquer others / Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.” Indeed.Alison PierceBuxted, East Sussex • Isn’t Project Fear becoming Project Reality?Sue CampbellCardiff • I want my brief letters back.Ros NapierBirmingham • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@ • The address in the first letter above was corrected on 30 June 2016.
