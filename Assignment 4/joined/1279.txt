Post Office workers are to stage a fresh strike in a dispute over jobs, closures and pensions. Members of the Communication Workers Union will walk out on Saturday, 3 December. The union is embroiled in a long-running row over the franchising of Crown post offices, the larger branches usually sited on high streets, job losses and the closure of a final salary pension scheme.  A 24-hour strike was held on Halloween, after similar action took place across the country in September. Dave Ward, general secretary of the CWU, said: “The Post Office is now at crisis point - it needs a new strategy as a matter of urgency.” Mark Davies, communications and corporate affairs director at the Post Office, said: “We are frustrated that our unions are again calling for strikes when we continue to try to reach a constructive way forward through talks, and have been inviting them to meet with our Group Executive to discuss our strategy in detail since April this year. Our latest invitation to meet on 22 December remains unanswered. “We can reassure our customers that, if a strike goes ahead on 3 December, the vast majority of people working at post office branches would not be involved and almost all of our network will be operating to its usual Saturday schedule.”
