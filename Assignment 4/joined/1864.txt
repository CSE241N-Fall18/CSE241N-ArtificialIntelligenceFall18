 Real Madrid dropped points for the second game in a row as a 2-2 draw away to Las Palmas allowed Barcelona to cut their lead at the top of La Liga to a single point. Zinedine Zidane’s men suffered the disappointment of missing out on a top-flight record 17 consecutive wins when they were held level by Villarreal at the Bernabéu on Wednesday night and they twice let leads slip in Gran Canaria on Saturday. Marco Asensio headed them in front but Tana equalised to leave the scores level at the break. Substitute Karim Benzema restored Real’s lead when he followed up to score after a Cristiano Ronaldo shot was blocked. The Portuguese looked deeply unimpressed to be substituted with 18 minutes to go, and his mood would not have been improved when Las Palmas equalised with five minutes left through Sergio Araujo. “We lost two points that are needed to win the league,” the Madrid striker Álvaro Morata said. “We had to win this game.” Zidane took Ronaldo off after 72 minutes with the Portugal captain, who had failed to score on Wednesday, having endured another disappointing performance. “He always wants to be on the pitch but we have a game on Tuesday and I felt he needed to rest,” Zidane said, referring to their Champions league match at Borussia Dortmund.
