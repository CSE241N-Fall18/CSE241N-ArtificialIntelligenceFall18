 Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou has savaged standards of European football, declaring the A-League to be as good as many overseas leagues. Returning from a scouting trip to name his latest World Cup qualifying squad, Postecoglou suggested he wasn’t eager to head back to watch overseas-based Australians in action. “Watch some football from Europe. It’s hard to watch. It’s very poor in standard,” he said. “I’m not just talking about the UK. I’ve just come back from Europe and I won’t mention the clubs but I saw a couple of first-division games and I could have walked out at half-time. “That’s not a knock on them, it’s paying credit to our competition.” Postecoglou said a case in point was Aaron Mooy, widely regarded as the best Australian in the A-League last season. Mooy was signed by Manchester City and loaned to second-tier Huddersfield Town, where he’s helped the unfashionable club climb to top of the table. The Asian Cup-winning coach suggested anyone who was surprised needed to take off their Europe-tinted glasses. “I’m not surprised and I don’t know why we should be,” he said. “The only surprise was he wasn’t picked up by a Premier League club. “I’m sure that will happen at some point. Maybe he’ll get Huddersfield up and they’ll sign him. “If anything I think he’s got more in him. They haven’t seen his goals yet and he’ll start scoring a few as well.” Postecoglou said despite the pain, he would persist with monitoring and scouting the full gamut of footballers eligible for Socceroos duty. “There’s no one that isn’t getting watched. Everyone’s getting assessed by me personally,” he said. He urged any local ‘Eurosnobs’ wanting to watch high-quality football to tune in to the A-League. “We shouldn’t continually seek some sort of validation for our competition,” he said. “If a player does well in our competition it means he’s got to be a good footballer.” The A-League kicks off on October 7 when Brisbane Roar host Melbourne Victory.
