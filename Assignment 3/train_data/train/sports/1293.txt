 Johanna Konta secured a place in the quarter-finals of the China Open with a rain-hit 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 victory over Karolina Pliskova in Beijing. British No1, aiming to force her way into contention for the WTA Finals in Singapore later this month, had moved into a 4-1 lead following an early break against the world No6 before the players were taken off the Lotus Court. The 25-year-old No11 seed picked up where she had left off in the previous round, breaking the Czech again before wrapping up the first set in just 27 minutes. Pliskova, however, produced a recovery in the second set, breaking Konta in a tight sixth game to lead 4-2 and then closing out her own service to level the match. Both players then failed to hold serve in a tense decider, although Konta saved three break points to lead 6-5 before Pliskova forced the tie-break. It was Konta who remained composed, the Briton making the most of an early mini-break to open up a 4-1 lead, which she pushed home to seal a place in the last eight against either the No4 seed Simona Halep or the Chinese player Zhang Shuai. Konta, ranked 14th in the world, is currently ninth in the race to Singapore, with the top eight qualifying for the tournament. There was a shock over on the National Tennis Stadium court, however, where the top seed and world No1 Angelique Kerber lost in straight sets – 6-3, 7-5 – to Elina Svitolina of Ukraine.
