With investors continuing to be unnerved by the prospect of Donald Trump winning next week’s US presidential election, leading shares are on the slide again. Pharmaceutical shares are under pressure after US lawmakers called on federal regulators to open a probe on potential price fixing for insulin and diabetes drugs. Although not mentioned, Hikma is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 146p at £15.99 after HSBC analysts cut their target price from £25.25 to £19.85 and warned all generic drugmakers could become caught up in a US Department of Justice investigation. But Numis moved from hold to buy ahead of an update from Hikma next week: Hikma’s shares are down 35% over three months and have significantly under- performed UK Mid-Cap Healthcare (+6%) and Global Specialty Pharma (-2%). The key risk to the investment case following the downgrades in August to 2016 forecasts are margin expectations from Generics that have disappointed since the acquisition of Roxane, which completed in early 2016. A third quarter update is expected next week and in the short term, a reduction to group revenue expectations for 2016 would be a disappointment, but in the absence of competition for Glycopyrrolate, view this as unlikely. A further reduction in margins for generics in 2016 is entirely possible, although we would argue this is now in the price. We take a more cautious stance on Generic margins into 2017, and reduce our earnings per share forecasts by 13% to 136c (consensus 156c). We see third quarter results on 10th November and the “Meet the Management” event on 15th November as the catalysts for a re-rating. The shares trade on 16 times 2017 PE for 23% earnings per share growth on our downgraded assumptions. We reduce our target price to 2,350p, which equates to 21 times 2017. This implies 35% upside on a 12- month view and so move to buy.  Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 95.11 points to 6695.40, on track for its biggest one day fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the continued Brexit brouhaha muddying the waters it is hard to see anything challenge the election for market dominance from now until next Wednesday, if Clinton wins, or god knows how long, in the eventuality of a Trump victory. The falls are across the board. British Airways owner International Airlines Group is down 16.1p to 434.7p despite telling investors it was sticking to its earnings and margins growth targets for now to 2020 despite the difficult trading environment. Dixons Carphone is down 12.6p at 328.9p on concerns about a coming squeeze on UK consumer spending, while Randgold Resources has fallen 220p to £68.90. But Paddy Power Betfair has bucked the trend, up 285p to £88.65 after it increased its full year profit forecast from £365m-£385m to £390m-£405m, citing the benefits of a weaker pound on its euro revenues. It reported earnings of £113m in the three months to the end of September, up 53%. Among the mid-caps DFS Furniture has fallen nearly 13% to 230.1p as US private equity firm Advent International sold a 12% stake in the business at 240p a share, cutting its investment in the retailer in half.
