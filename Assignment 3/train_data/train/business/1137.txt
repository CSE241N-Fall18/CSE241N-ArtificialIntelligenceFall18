Markets have drifted lower, with insurer Admiral leading the fallers and despite better than expected UK jobs data, which showed an unexpected fall in the claimant count. But Indivior, a healthcare spin off from Reckitt Benckiser, is in the spotlight, jumping around 17% to 352.1p after its drug for opoid use disorder cleared Phase 3 trials. In a buy note Jefferies analysts said: Indivior has reported top-line data for its once-monthly injectable treatment for opioid use disorder, RBP-6000. Both primary and secondary endpoints were met & full analysis of the data is due by the first quarter of 2017. This leaves the product on track for end-2017 approval in the US assuming Priority Review. We believe this positive development may help alleviate concerns and repair sentiment given recent R&D challenges.  Cantor Fitzgerald was also positive: The announcement of positive top line results for the pivotal long acting depot formulation (RBP-6000) of buprenorphine further de-risks the Indivior investment case we believe and should provide longevity to the franchise which is currently dominated by the threatened Suboxone film franchise. Indeed, we have previously noted that retention of a strong film franchise was central to the launch of the differentiated and more convenient depot formulation. Overall the FTSE 100 has dipped 9.23 points to 6884.69, slightly better than before the UK unemployment figures. Admiral is down 177p at £20.77 as warned market volatility following the Brexit vote had hit its solvency ratio. Standard Chartered is 21.6p lower at 631.5p as analysts at HSBC moved from hold to buy. Mining shares were mixed, with Antofagasta down 10p to 548.5p but BHP Billiton added another 8p to 1057.5p after Tuesday’s better than expected full year loss of $6.39bn. Building materials group CRH is up 52p to £25.64 based on its exposure to the US construction market and its possible addition to the Euro Stoxx 50 index, according to CMC Markets. Balfour Beatty is 18.2p better at 262.6p after its first half results showed a £7m profit, in contrast to the loss expected by analysts. Cobham has climbed 6.3p to 166.6p as the aerospace and defence group replaced its chief executive with David Lockwood, the current boss of technology company Laird, down 21.5p at 309.5p.
