Mining shares are supporting the UK market despite a series of disappointing updates elsewhere putting pressure on shares. A strong production update from Anglo American has lifted its shares 4% to £11.10 and also pushed Antofagasta 18p higher to 543p, Rio Tinto up 79.5p to £27.55 and Glencore 6.15p better at 243.75p. Recent signs of stability in the Chinese economy has also helped sentiment. But Whitbread has fallen 98p to £37.45 after the Premier Inns and Costa Coffee reported slowing sales at the drinks business. GKN is down 8.2p at 315p as the engineering group said growth rates were easing in its major markets. Meanwhile Intu Properties has dropped 2.9p to 288.3p as it said occupancy levels at its shopping centres had fallen since June by 0.6% to 95.6%. It said new lettings in the year had more than offset the 1% impact from the closure of BHS. It also agreed to sell its 63% stake in a Bromley shopping centre for £177.9m, which it said was around 1% higher than its value before the Brexit vote. The property market was one of the main victims of the turmoil in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result. In a reduce note, analysts at Numis said: In a deal that we see as being a short term positive for sentiment, Intu has sold Bromley slightly ahead of book value. Trading through the third quarter did not see a material change versus the half year and management has reiterated its 3-4% like for like net rental income guidance. Our key issue is that Intu remains highly leveraged and capital consumptive, and we see better value elsewhere.  Royal Bank of Scotland is under pressure on continuing concerns about fines it may be liable for, down 5.7p at 182.3p. Overall, with the rise in mining shares, the FTSE 100 has added 36.10 points to 7022.50. Among the mid-caps, Petra Diamonds continues to benefit from its recent update, 5.8p better at153.5p, but pubs group Mitchells & Butlers is down 14.8p at 267.8p after Citigroup issued a sell recommendation.
