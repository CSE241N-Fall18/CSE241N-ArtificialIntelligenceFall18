Further to Michele Hanson’s protest at the anticipated sealing of urban red postboxes (A certain age, G2, 20 September), when in west Wales last week my wife went to send her sister’s 70th birthday card but inadvertently put it in an acquired residential red postbox marked Post Office set into someone’s wall. As the owners were out, we left them a note (red-faced), apologising for the inconvenience and requesting they put it in the official Royal Mail postbox nearby. The card duly arrived in London on time the next day. So perhaps the answer is more community-mindedness like this to help make the necessary savings, rather than using impersonal digital greetings.YZ KleinLondon • We in Hull are being trained to accept the loss of our local pillar boxes; our nearest box says it is emptied at 9am daily, and at 7am on Saturdays, which feels as if I have missed the post every day before I have begun to surface or written the day’s letters. For me, that encouraging sign reading “Monday to Friday 5.30pm” meant a last-minute dash (no time for plodding at 5.25pm) and an amble home with a sense of achievement and some neighbourly chats en route.   Now, when planning my day, I take note of which post office I will be passing; the achievement these days is to catch the earlier van at 3.45 rather than risk the 5.30 collection, because even a first class stamp no longer guarantees delivery the following day. And what about post offices themselves? What a falling-off is here – our venerable old stone building, neighbour to the Guildhall, is now a Wetherspoons; and the main “facility” in WH Smith’s has queues akin to TS Eliot’s on London Bridge.Stephanie WilsonHull
