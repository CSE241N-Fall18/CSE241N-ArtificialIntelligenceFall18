Nils Pratley (PM needs to stand firm on executive pay ratios, 29 November) alerts us to the fact that directors are already lobbying hard to water down Theresa May’s early proposal to shed light on employee pay ratios. May was unrelenting in her support for the austerity policies imposed by her government since 2010 and the havoc they have created for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our in our society. Now’s the time for her to do what she said she would do. What’s the risk in making companies publish details of every employee’s terms and contracts of employment, pension contributions, share options, severance terms, expense account arrangements, perks etc? Not all boardrooms are full of self-serving, me-first executives. However, many are. It was the boards of our leading banks and financial institutions – working hand in glove with some of the most unsavoury characters in the business world – who created the problems we are facing today. It’s time for business leaders to stand up and be counted. How many can truly say that their employees are fairly treated?David BeswickHarrogate, North Yorkshire • As regards worker representation on boards, “We are not going to make it happen,” Greg Clark told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding that the government did not want to “overturn what has been a successful system which has had the confidence of business around the world”. Success for whom or what, one should ask; it certainly has not been good for the workers, whom the government supposedly represents – democracy does not include votes from self-serving legal entities. We also should consider its success in Germany and other European countries.
