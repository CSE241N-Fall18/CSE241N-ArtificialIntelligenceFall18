The price of a basket of 20 Unilever products, including Hellman’s mayonnaise, Carte D’Or ice cream and Comfort fabric conditioner has risen by an average of 5.7% across the UK’s major supermarkets since the Brexit vote, as the pound’s post-referendum struggles feed through to shop shelves. Analysis by the Guardian and price comparison site MySupermarket.com of 20 everyday items made by the Anglo-Dutch supplier indicates volatility in prices since the poll. Despite the furore over the company’s Marmite, which has become the unlikely symbol of the battle between retailers and Unilever over price rises, Bertolli spread saw the most inflation of the 20 products monitored by MySupermarket – up 31.5% on average across the UK’s four largest supermarket chains.  The rising cost of Bertolli and VO5 styling mousse, which was up nearly 15%, along with price rises on 14 other items, offset cuts on a handful of items including chicken and mushroom Pot Noodle. Marmite was included in the basket of 20 goods but its price slipped slightly overall, by 0.78% on average across the four chains, as a price cut at Asda offset a price increase at Morrisons.  The evidence of shop floor price rises for Unilever products comes after it emerged that Birds Eye, the fish finger maker, and Walkers crisps are asking supermarkets for price rises of up to 12% as the fall in the value of the pound has pushed up their costs. The major supermarkets are keen to keep price rises to a minimum as they try to hold off competition from the fast-growing discount chains Aldi and Lidl. But retailers and suppliers are finding it difficult to absorb price increases caused by the 14.5% drop in the value of the pound against the euro and 18% against the dollar since the UK voted to leave the European Union. Analysis by the Guardian indicates that prices on Unilever products have risen the most at Morrisons since the Brexit vote, where they rose nearly 9%, closely followed by Sainsbury’s, where they were up 8.6%. On the basket of 20 Unilever goods, Sainsbury’s is the most expensive supermarket, at £40.26 in total, after an average 8.6% rise in the price of the measured Unilever goods in the past month alone, the biggest month-on-month jump of the big four. Asda is the cheapest on £37.90, followed by Tesco on £39.58 and Morrisons on £39.31. Supermarkets said that the picture painted by the MySupermarket data was skewed because it does not include multibuy deals. The range of 20 products is also just a fraction of the dozens of items supplied by Unilever and of the more than 25,000 products stocked in a typical supermarket outlet. A spokesman for Morrisons said: “The figures from MySupermarket almost certainly include items where promotional prices have reverted to the everyday price and this isn’t a price increase.” It said there had been an almost equal number of price cuts to price decreases across all the Unilever products Morrisons stocks. A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We remain focused on providing customers with quality and value, offering great prices on the products that matter most to them, like Marmite (250g) – £2.50 since July 2014. We sell hundreds of Unilever brands and this limited assortment of items, a tiny proportion of the total Unilever products we sell, provides neither a fair or accurate representation of the value customers find when they shop with us.” The biggest increase in the price of Bertolli spread, for example, was at Asda – 63% – although its price was still the cheapest of the big four chains, according to MySupermarket. The other major price rises were nearly all on health and beauty products. True Love Impulse Body Spray, Simple Kind to Skin Hydrating Light Moisturiser and VO5 Styling Mousse Extra Body marked double-digit price rises on average across the four chains. Solero Exotic ice cream also rose by more than 10% – although this was largely down to major price rises at Morrisons and Tesco.
