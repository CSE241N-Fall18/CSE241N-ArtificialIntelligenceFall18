Australian shares have plunged to a four-month low and lost $35bn in value amid a global shock from US election results that have left Donald Trump poised to become the next president of the United States. Stunned investors sold down Australian stocks on Wednesday during a rollercoaster day during which market fortunes rose with early hopes of a win for Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton, then plunged as the Republican challenger built a strong lead as counting progressed. The benchmark S&P/ASX200 closed 1.9% lower after gaining more than 1% in morning trade. Stocks had plummeted to a deeper intra-day low than was suffered after the shock UK vote in June to leave the European Union but recovered towards the end of trading. Asian markets joined the rout, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 index plunging more than 5% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index shedding almost 3% as their afternoon sessions continued. Futures trading showed US markets are also poised to open lower, with the Dow Jones futures index 3.7% lower. At the close of trade in Australia, Trump had secured 244 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to secure the presidency, well ahead of Clinton’s 215. Bell Direct equities analyst Julia Lee said markets didn’t like uncertainty and Trump was seen as an unknown quantity. “Hillary Clinton is seen as a known candidate, the markets are familiar with her while with Donald Trump, there’s a perception he makes policies on the go,” Lee said. All sectors on the ASX closed deep in the red, with the banks, health and energy sectors suffering the biggest declines.
