After an initial attempt to recover from recent losses, leading shares are struggling to cling onto the day’s gains. Oil shares are among the biggest fallers after crude prices slid further in the wake of a downbeat report from the International Energy Agency. The agency said the oil market would be oversupplied until at least the first six months of 2017, given a sharp slowdown in demand and rising stocks. A month ago it predicted suppy and demand would be broadly in balance for the rest of the year, and inventories would fall sharply. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The IEA has joined OPEC in pouring more cold water on the oil price this morning. After OPEC flipped its prediction of dwindling non-OPEC supply in 2017, instead warning that it was set to rise due to a major new oilfield in Kazakhstan coming online, the IEA has issued a stark warning that the pickup in demand seen in the first half of the year has completely evaporated. It has cut its demand forecasts for the second half and the whole of 2017 and is now predicting the glut will remain in the global market for the whole of next year. Oil prices are down this morning, although the real capitulation could come towards the end of the month if OPEC and Russia fail to agree a supply freeze Brent crude is down more than 2% to $47.29 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has slipped 2.46% to $45.15. So BP is down 5.9p at 422.80p while Royal Dutch Shell A shares are 22.5p lower at 1834.5p. A number of mining shares are also under pressure, with Anglo American down 3.9p at 815.6p and BHP Billiton 3.7p lower at 987.3p. Overall the FTSE 100 is up just 5.04 points at 6705.94, with little impact from the better than expected UK inflation figures. Associated British Foods is again the biggest faller after Monday’s disappointing figures, down another 96p to £27.19. Jefferies moved from hold to underperform, saying: Despite the precipitous, full year IMS triggered ABF sell-off, we remain concerned that the Primark investment debate will now revolve around more normalised valuation criteria. With a third successive year of Primark margin falls now expected for 16/17, we value the division on 23 times PE, and see double-digit downside to the stock. Shopping centre specialist Intu Properties has dropped 6.6p to 288.8p as Deutsche Bank moved from hold to sell. It said: We do not see the ‘scenario weighted’ risk/reward as attractive given we would expect Intu to materially underperform in a UK downturn. We note that Intu has high EPS sensitivity to like for like growth and also capital values. Given 97% of asset value is UK shopping centres and given an loan-to-value off 44%, we see high sensitivity to a down-cycle should it occur. We forecast a c.20% capital value decline driving a c.35% decline in net asset value. With the stock trading at a 15% premium to our 2018 NAV forecast, we downgrade to sell.  Among the mid-caps, contrasting fortunes for two retailers after their updates. JD Sports Fashion has jumped 71p to £14.04 as it reported a 73% rise in first half profits. But online grocer Ocado is down 44.5p at 277.5p on disappointment at the lack of news on an international tie-up and continuing pressure on its profit margins.
