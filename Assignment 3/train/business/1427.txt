Leading shares have recovered some ground but are still in negative territory, with oil companies weighing on the FTSE 100. BP is down 6.85p at 486.65p while Royal Dutch Shell B shares are 25p lower at 2145.5p. Both companies are due to report results next week, and the continuing uncertainty over whether oil producers can agree a deal to cut output at an Opec meeting next month is continuing to weigh on the sector. Concerns about oversupply have outweighed news of better than expected third quarter results from Total. Brent crude is currently down 0.2% at $50.39 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate is 0.3% lower at $49.57. David Cheetham, market analyst at online trader XTB, said: One of the worst performing sectors in the FTSE 100 this morning is energy, with BP and Royal Dutch Shell both experiencing some fairly sizeable selling. [Crude is] set for a first red close for the week since the middle of September as some doubts are emerging around the chances of a successfully implemented deal amongst Opec members to reduce output. Overall the FTSE 100 is now down 16.07 points at 6970.50, having earlier fallen as low as 6927. Further weakness in sterling - down 0.17% at $1.2140 after a Northern Ireland court rejected a Brexit challenge - has helped pull the leading index back from its worst levels. Among the mid-caps commercial laundry business Berendsen, down 40.5p at 989.5p, and oilfield services group Amec Foster, 16.4p lower at 449.5p, both continue to suffer from disappointing trading updates on Thursday.
