The British winemaker Chapel Down has seen sales rise by more than 25% in the first half of the year, as people continue to show enthusiasm for English wine and craft beer. Frazer Thompson, the Chapel Down chief executive, said: “We continue to deliver good growth [in] sales and gross profits. Consumers’ interest in English wines and specialist or craft beer shows no sign of abating and Chapel Down has worked hard to be well positioned to benefit.” The company, based near Tenterden, Kent, has also enjoyed major growth in its beer and cider business, Curious Drinks, which makes Curious Brew lager. In May, Chapel Down became an official wine supplier to Downing Street and its range is sold at Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Majestic, Marks & Spencer and Booths. Overall sales rose by 26% to £4.1m in the six months to 30 June, the company said. Wine sales increased by 14% to £2.6m, and beer and cider sales under the Curious Drinks arm rocketed by 55% to £1.51m. Gross profit for wines was up by 18% at £1m, and beer and cider profit was £473,000, a 55% increase. Earnings before interest, taxes and other charges grew by 11% to £93,000. Earlier this year, the company raised £1.7m through crowdfunding to help increase Curious Drinks production. The money is being used to build a brewery near Ashford International station and help develop the business.  Thompson said he was optimistic of further good growing conditions during the rest of the year. “We are encouraged by the prospect of another good harvest in 2016, with excellent quality, which will enable us to continue to improve the quality of our wines and help our goal to have supply in place to meet future demand,” he said.
