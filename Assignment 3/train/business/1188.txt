Tubs of one of Ben & Jerry’s best-known ice creams have been recalled over fears they may contain small pieces of metal. Some consumers who bought 500ml cartons of Cookie Dough are being told not to eat it and instead throw it away. Four batches of the ice-cream are thought to be affected, with UK customers being asked to check batch numbers printed at the bottom of their pots. The company issued an “important safety notice” after internal quality assurance checks showed a limited number of products could be affected. It said: “The company has identified a specific production period during which Ben & Jerry’s Cookie Dough 500ml may have been affected and, as safety remains a top priority, Ben & Jerry’s is voluntarily recalling four batch codes of Cookie Dough 500ml from sale. “As a precaution, everyone with a 500ml tub of Ben & Jerry’s Cookie Dough in their freezers at home should check the batch number on the bottom of their tub to make sure it’s not affected. “And, if it matches the batch numbers listed above, they should not eat the product and, instead, we ask them to discard the product in the usual household bin.” The batch codes affected are L62110L011, L62111L011, L62112L011 and L62113L011. Consumers who have to throw away a tub of the ice cream can call 0800 146 252 to find out how to receive a voucher for a free pot.
