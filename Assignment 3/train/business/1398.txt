The strong dollar, boosted by US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen’s hints on Thursday of a December rate rise, has hit commodity companies, particularly gold and silver. So precious metal miners are leading the market lower, with gold down more than 1%. The metal is priced in the US currency so is sensitive to dollar movements, and at the same time investors are turning away from its haven status, believing Donald Trump’s expansionary plans could boost corporate profits and equities. Randgold Resoures is the biggest falling in the FTSE 100, down 380p at £57.05 despite unveiling a joint venture with Newcrest in the Cote d’Ivoire. Mexican precious metal miner Fresnillo has fallen 64p to £13.24, while among the mid-caps gold miner Centamin has lost 7.2p to 132.7p. It is not just precious metal miners. Antofagasta has fallen 24.5p to 663p and Rio Tinto is down 77.5p at 2943.5p. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently down 47.05 points at 6747.66. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said The UK index wasn’t helped by a sluggish commodity sector; the greenback’s surge has pushed Brent Crude under $46 per barrel and gold back towards $1200 per ounce, in the process dragging the FTSE’s oil and mining stocks in the red.  Rolls-Royce continues to slide in the wake of its update this week, down another 21p at 678p as Emirates Airline said it was having technical issues with new engines for the A380. Among the risers Intertek is up 54p at £32.42 ahead of the testing equipment group’s next update, despite Deutsche Bank cutting its target price from £35 to £34. The bank did raise its earnings per share forecast thanks to benefits from a weaker pound, saying: We are cutting our full year organic growth forecast from 1.0% to 0.4%. This implies ~0.4% in the second half versus. 0.5% in the first. We cut our view of a potential recovery next year from 2.5% growth to 1.4% growth due to ongoing weakness in Oil & Gas related activity. Due to weakness in Oil & Gas we are also nudging down our operating margin forecasts by 10bps in both years, despite some benefit from acquisitions. Our forecasts imply a full year EBITA margin decline of 10bps versus guidance of a broadly stable margin. Due to further significant foreign exchange changes since we last updated our forecasts our earnings per share forecast for 2017 now rises by 10% to 178p. We are now broadly in line with consensus.  Software specialist Sage is up 6.5p at 681.5p as Goldman Sachs raised its target price from 850p to 870p. Among the mid-caps Electrocomponents has jumped 10% to a 14 year high of 408.1p, after the electronic component distributor raised its full year cost saving target from £25m to £30m and said its half year profits were up 76%. Liberum analysts said: These results should provide investors with a great deal of comfort and provide clear evidence of the upside potential of the group’s self-help strategy...Management have also provided a positive outlook for both revenues and margins and we would expect upgrades to consensus of 8-10% for the full year 2017.
