 Breaking off your engagement and almost losing your career would push most 21-year-olds into deep depression but Kim Clijsters appears to have emerged from a hideous year a wiser and happier person. She won her first-round match against Nicole Pratt at the Pacific Life Open 6-2, 6-1 just as easily as she might before her life was turned upside down by a severe, stubborn wrist injury and the break-up, in October, of her four-year relationship with Lleyton Hewitt.  Now, says Clijsters, "I'm very happy," despite being world No133 and therefore unseeded here. Her ranking has plummeted from No2 in a year.  Six months at home nursing the wrist gave Clijsters time to reflect on her career and private life. "It's the longest I've been at home since I was a kid. For my personal life, it's all been good. It made me stronger."  She also had to face the possibility that the wrist might never recover enough to allow her to reach the top of her sport again. "I started thinking, 'What am I going to do?' But I didn't want to think like that. I didn't accept it. I missed tennis so much. It was a great feeling to play my first match back."  That came in her home town of Antwerp last month, where she lost in the quarter-finals to Venus Williams.
