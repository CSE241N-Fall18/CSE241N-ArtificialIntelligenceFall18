 Steve McClaren is hoping for a much-needed double transfer breakthrough as he attempts to drag Newcastle United out of yet another worrying tailspin. The Bordeaux midfielder Henri Saivet is understood to be on Tyneside on Monday to discuss a potential move, and the club are also understood to have formalised their long-held interest in Swansea’s Jonjo Shelvey. Saivet, a 25-year-old Senegal international, has spent much of his career playing as a winger but has occupied a central role for his club this season and will cost in excess of £4m. Bordeaux confirmed on Monday that they had reached a deal with Newcastle and McClaren said in his press conference that the player “was in the building” to have his medical. McClaren confirmed that Henri Saviet is on Tyneside having a medical and discussing terms. "We are just waiting for the outcome." #NUFC Shelvey, who was coveted by Alan Pardew during the former Newcastle manager’s time at St James’ Park, appears to be heading out of Swansea after losing his place under first Garry Monk and then Alan Curtis. He was reportedly involved in a row with a Swansea fan following the club’s 3-2 FA Cup third round defeat by League Two Oxford on Sunday. Shelvey has been linked with a £10m switch to Newcastle as McClaren attempts to end a run of four consecutive 1-0 defeats to ease themselves out of the relegation zone with home games against Manchester United on Tuesday and West Ham at the weekend.
