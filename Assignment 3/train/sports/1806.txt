 The West Bromwich Albion winger James McClean has signed a new two-and-a-half year deal. Albion have confirmed the 27-year-old has agreed an improved contract, which also includes an option for another year at The Hawthorns. He joined the club from Wigan in 2015 and the head coach, Tony Pulis, believes the Republic of Ireland international has been a bargain. “For what we’ve paid and what the lad’s been earning, he’s been a terrific signing for us,” he said. “He’s been a good lad and he’s not been in the team lately but his attitude in training and around the place is great. He’s scatty, but he’s a good lad with it, he’s not a bad lad. He’s been knocking on my door a few times [to get in the team].” McClean has made 58 appearances, scoring four times, for Albion since his switch from Wigan and he follows Ben Foster and Craig Gardner in signing new terms this season. Albion go to Southampton on Saturday before hosting Hull on Monday although McClean has not started for the team in their last six games. Meanwhile,Pulis could rotate his side with two games in 48 hours and Jonny Evans is nursing a minor thigh problem following the 1-0 defeat at Arsenal on Boxing Day. Pulis said: “We’ll look at one or two today and if they have niggles and are struggling we won’t take chances and leave them for Hull.”
