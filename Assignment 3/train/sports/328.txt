 The view from a field high up at the edge of Castle Cary might well have inspired the snapshot survey of English history shown to the world at the Olympic opening ceremony, and indeed it features Glastonbury Tor, which was represented at that event. My scan started with the ridge of Lodge Hill (the site of a Norman castle) rising beyond the town on my left, then, a little to the right, the slender spire of the gothic parish church rebuilt in 1855, and next, much closer, the ornate pile of the Priory, originally Florida House, built by a local industrialist in the 1870s with its cupola at the top of a tower from which, it is said, he could keep an eye on his workers. Then there was a distant view across the Somerset levels, where King Alfred burned the cakes, interrupted, a little farther round, by the sudden rise of the tor itself, and then the square tower of Ansford Church, where the 18th-century diarist Parson Woodforde worshipped. On the day I was there, the field was alive with a sense of occasion; there were tents, family picnics, deckchairs and flags. Television has rightly celebrated Greenwich Park, the Queen's House, Hampton Court, the Mall, the Dorset coastline and Lord's, but here was an Olympic occasion at unheralded Castle Cary cricket ground. The match I went to see there was a commemoration of one played in Paris, part of the 1900 Olympics, in which Great Britain and France were the only teams competing for cricket honours. Britain was represented by the Somerset and Devon Wanderers, a touring side made up of members of Castle Cary Cricket Club and old boys of Blundell's School in Devon. Britain won, and medals were retrospectively awarded in 1912, gold to Britain and silver to France. And now, in conjunction with London 2012, the French president's XI was here to celebrate the centenary on a field that offered them a remarkable English panorama to savour between the overs.
