 Saúl Ñíguez’s second-half strike gave Atlético Madrid a 1-0 win at home to Las Palmas on Saturday, their first victory in four games in all competitions. He lashed a loose ball into the top corner from outside the box to break the deadlock in the 59th minute and bring welcome relief to Atlético after a week in which they all but dropped out of the title race and lost the goalkeeper Jan Oblak to injury. Saúl came close to giving Atlético the lead in the first half but saw his driven shot clatter against the post, while down at the other end Las Palmas defender Mauricio Lemos let fly from some distance and struck the crossbar. Kévin Gameiro wasted a clear chance to strike before the break but tried in vain to pass to strike partner Antoine Griezmann and it was then up to Saúl to score Atletico’s first goal in four games and their first in December. “This goal comes at the right time in what has been an up-and-down season so far,” he said. “It helped the team win and it brings confidence.” Villarreal ended a three-month spell without an away win in all competitions by coasting to a 3-1 victory at Sporting Gijon to tighten their grip on fourth spot. The visitors went ahead in the 12th minute through Jonathan dos Santos’s thumping drive and Nicola Sansone doubled the advantage in the 20th by stabbing in Alexandre Pato’s goal-bound shot from close range. Sansone returned the favour for Pato in the second half by laying on the pass for the Brazilian to round off Villarreal’s first win on the road since they beat Malaga on 10 September. Sporting got a late consolation goal through Carlos Carmona. Villarreal are fourth on 29 points and are guaranteed to finish the year in the Champions League places. Barcelona host Espanyol on Sunday hoping to eat into Real Madrid’s six-point lead at the top, with Zinedine Zidane’s side absent from league action this week owing to playing in the Club World Cup final against Kashima Antlers.
