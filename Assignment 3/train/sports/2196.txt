 Last season's beaten Davis Cup finalists Australia put up a brave fight with their second-string team before they were dumped out of the world group, eliminated 3-0 by Argentina on clay in Buenos Aires.  The home doubles pair Guillermo Canas and Lucas Arnold took nearly four hours to beat Wayne Arthurs and Todd Woodbridge 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 10-8 to earn a place in the quarter-final round.  The veteran Australian doubles pair had problems with the rain-dampened clay surface and later Arthurs blamed the day-long showers, saying: "We expected a tough match, but we had been training hard in extreme heat and today it drizzled during all five sets."  It was disappointment but hardly a shock on the slow surface for the Australians who were without their three top players. But the stand-in Scott Draper flew the flag when he took the world No15 Canas to five sets in the opening singles.  In Metz, the holders France went through to a quarter-final with the Czech Republic when Sebastien Grosjean saw off 3 hours of heroics by the Dutchman Sjeng Schalken in yesterday's first reverse singles. Schalken, who played a total of 14 sets over the match's three days, was finally beaten 6-2, 1-6, 7-6, 2-6, 6-3 by the French No1. The Czechs crushed 4-1 a Brazil team lacking their No1 Gustavo Kuerten.  In Moscow, Russia edged into a quarter-final date with Britain's conquerors Sweden after a thrilling 3-2 victory over battling Switzerland, clinched by Marat Safin's 6-1, 7-6, 6-4 win over Michel Kratochvil yesterday.  The strong home side, with two top 20 players, led 2-1 after the doubles but Roger Federer followed up his superb win over Safin in the opening singles with an heroic 7-6, 6-1, 6-1 drubbing of Yevgeny Kafelnikov yesterday.
