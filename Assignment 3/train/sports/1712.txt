 A point from their last two games has checked Stoke’s rise and they will be without Marko Arnautovic over most of the Christmas period after his red card in the draw with Southampton. They are, at least, well stocked in attack and Mame Biram Diouf or Wilfried Bony will come in. Leicester would just like consistency: they lost 1-0 at Bournemouth on Tuesday – some anticlimax after their heroics against Manchester City.
