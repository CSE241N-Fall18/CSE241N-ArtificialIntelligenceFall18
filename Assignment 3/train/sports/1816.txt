 Hamburg fans have launched a petition urging their club to sign Northern Ireland’s Will Grigg following the striker’s unlikely rise to international fame during Euro 2016. Grigg failed to make it off Northern Ireland’s bench in France, but became one of the names of the tournament after the 90s song Freed From Desire was adapted in his honour. Will Grigg’s On Fire reached No6 in the official iTunes chart. The 24-year-old, who finished last season as top scorer in League One as Wigan Athletic secured promotion, has been linked with Celtic, Hull and Nottingham Forest, but Hamburg fans want their club to join the race. The petition, which has attracted more than 5,000 signatures, says: “Grigg has a market value of €1.5m (£1.2m). The striker enjoys an international reputation and would probably [pay for himself] several times over through merchandising.” It claims the deal would “finally bring proper atmosphere to the stadium” and would provide a cult hero for “the club, and the city … the HSV fans need a player like Grigg.” After arriving home, Grigg admitted he was “massively disappointed” that his only impact on the tournament had been musical. “I try to stay away from the song,” he said. “I certainly haven’t been singing it myself because I find it all a bit awkward. I’m a footballer and the whole point of being here was to play football. But to hear the support I’ve been getting from the fans has been fantastic.”
