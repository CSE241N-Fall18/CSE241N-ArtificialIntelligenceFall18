 Antoine Griezmann scored twice and set up another to jump start Atlético Madrid’s league title challenge, as they won 4-0 against Celta Vigo. Atlético’s win came after disappointing draws with two promoted sides, Leganés and Alavés, leaving them trailing Barcelona and Real Madrid. Griezmann had been scathing in his criticism after those draws, warning the team could be in the “relegation fight” instead of the title race for a fourth straight year. The France forward led by example at the Balaídos stadium, and also apologised for doubting his team. “I had to play a match like that,” he said. “I am very happy with the team, for our effort. I want to say I am sorry for what I said [after the Leganés draw] because I shouldn’t have said it in public.” Griezmann, who was named the best player at this summer’s European Championship for leading France to the final, showed why he is sometimes seen as La Liga’s most valuable player. While Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are surrounded by top talent at Barcelona and Real Madrid, Griezmann almost single-handedly decided the match. He sparked Atlético into life after an ineffective first half. His move wide allowed Koke to slip forward, and Griezmann found his run with a pinpoint cross for the midfielder to volley home in the 52nd minute. Griezmann’s delicate header into the corner from Saúl Ñíguez’s cross doubled the lead in the 73rd minute, and he followed that with a second header eight minutes later from Juanfran’s cross. Ángel Correa, on as a substitute, scored the fourth.
