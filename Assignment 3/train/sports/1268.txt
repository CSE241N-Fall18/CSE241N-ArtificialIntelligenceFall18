 Svetlana Kuznetsova is one win away from qualifying for the WTA Finals in Singapore at the expense of Britain’s Johanna Konta after fighting her way into the final of the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. The defending champion and top seed defeated Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina 6-1, 6-7, 6-4 in the last four. If she can win the final, the Russian will overtake Konta, who was named most improved player of the year on Friday, and claim the final spot for the season-ending eight-woman showpiece. Konta is in Singapore and has been taking part in the buildup to the event but, having been sidelined by an abdominal injury, she can do nothing but watch and wait. It is a far from ideal situation for all involved, with the draw taking place on Friday despite only seven of the participants being known. The world No1, Angelique Kerber, is in the Red Group alongside Simona Halep, Madison Keys and Dominika Cibulkova. The second seed Agnieszka Radwanska is joined in the White Group by Karolina Pliskova, the French Open champion Garbiñe Muguruza and either Konta or Kuznetsova.
